<p>Ivan plays an integral role at SAI Global assessing the sustainability of fishery stocks against global standards such as the Marine Stewardship Council's (MSC) sustainable fishing standard and the Alaska Responsible Fisheries Management (RFM) Certification Program. <br /><br /></p>
<blockquote><p>I’m honoured to receive this award for the work I do on behalf of SAI Global and on behalf of the specialist group of fishery assessors working to assist fisheries around the world demonstrate their sustainability credentials against globally recognised standards. Not only does certification help protect global marine ecosystem biodiversity, it provides consumers with confidence selecting seafood that has been sustainably managed and responsibly fished.</p><p>Ivan Matteo</p><p>SAI Global, Fisheries Assessment Officer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To have such a reputable organisation as SoFHT recognise Ivan's work is fantastic. It also serves to highlight the enormous contribution standards and certification make to ensure responsibly managed and sustainable fisheries. With good marine science, sound fisheries management and careful stewardship of the world's marine resources, seafood has the potential to feed the world's population now and in the future. Standards such as MSC and RFM are pioneering the attainment of these values and we're proud to be part of this marine sustainability agenda.</p><p>David Garforth</p><p>Senior Consultant for Seafood at SAI Global</p></blockquote><p>Dr Mateo has a strong academic and professional background in fishery science, fish bioenergetics, fish stock assessment modelling and marine conservation.  Familiar with fisheries of all sizes across a diverse range of marine ecosystems including tropical, temperate and artic environs, Ivan's knowledge of fish species and fishing methods is exceptional.   </p>
<p>Ivan leads a number of MSC and RFM fishery certifications and pre-assessments including: Pacific Albacore Tuna, Scotia Fundy Haddock, Gulf of Saint Lawrence Snow Crab, Alaska Salmon and Pacific Halibut.<br />
Of note, on behalf of WWF-Canada and the Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union (FFAW-Unifor), Ivan lead a pre-assessment of Newfoundland's Northern Cod Stock. This was part of a collaborative project to improve fishery sustainability through attaining MSC certification.  This project seeks to reverse the current state of this fishery stock; largely regarded as one of the world's most iconic, fishery stock decimations resulting from decades of unsustainable over-fishing. </p>
<p>SAI Global delivers audits and certification to the world's leading seafood standards; MSC, Alaska RFM, Iceland RFM, G.U.L.F RFM, GAA BAP, ASC, Global GAP, IFFO RS, Organic as well as the full suite of GFSI benchmarked and relevant supply chain standards such as BRC, IFS and ISO, CoC and internal retail/customer specific standards.  <br />
SAI Global seafood personnel are sector and program specific specialists in seafood.  Academically accomplished and professionally adept, the team are courteously objective and passionate about the business of seafood sustainability.</p>
<p>Established in 1979, international membership organisation SoFHT supports the work of food industry professionals involved in all aspects of food hygiene.  The SoFHT Awards, as judged by a panel of experienced industry professionals celebrate outstanding achievements by businesses and individuals to food safety and sustainability. <br /><br /></p>

<p>If we cast our minds back to the Wannacry attacks - many of the organisations impacted, were vulnerable due to their use of an outdated operating system. Notably, hospitals under the UK's NHS were in this group, with crippling ramifications for patients and those seeking medical care<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>While these organisations were aware that there was a risk in maintaining an outdated operating system, critically, they did not understand the extent of that risk. According to cybersecurity expert David Simpson of CQR Consulting, the organisations in question “accepted the risks without understanding the real consequences”. This highlights a fundamental challenge when it comes to cybersecurity - if you don't have enough understanding of the risk in question, how can you make a good risk choice?</p>
<p>The area of cybersecurity is often plagued by a lack of understanding, unclear technical jargon and in some cases wilful ignorance, along the lines of - “that will happen to some other company, we have a firewall”. A recent Minter Ellison report showed that 22% of respondents in their Board Survey considered their Board to be 'not at all' informed and kept appraised of cyber risk issues<sup>3</sup>. With all this uncertainty, too often cybersecurity is relegated to the IT department without the buy-in and understanding required from leadership and the wider organisation.  </p>
<p>This lack of buy-in and training organisation-wide, presents an issue when we consider the case of Wannacry and any spear phishing or ransomwear attack, in which every user plays a role in making a good risk choice. Too often, leadership teams look for a 'silver bullet' technology solution to prevent cyberattacks without a real commitment to embed information security into processes and organisational culture. Dante Disparte and Chris Furlow of the Harvard Business Review said that “spending millions on security technology can certainly make an executive feel safe. But the major sources of cyber threats aren't technological. They're found in the human brain in the form of curiosity, ignorance, apathy, and hubris”<sup>3</sup>. </p>
<blockquote><p>The organisations in question “accepted the risks without understanding the real consequences”.</p><p>David Simpson</p><p>CQR Consulting</p></blockquote><p>So, what can organisations do right now to begin to address cyber risk? David Simpson makes the following recommendations: </p>
<ol><li>Start to understand your technology risk and your exposure areas. This is particularly true when it comes to aging infrastructure, patching is important in this process to ensure you are maintaining your defences. David's recommendation is that “if you don't understand your risks you can't manage them”.<br /><br /></li><li>Risks require active and ongoing management. For some organisations risk management starts and ends at the identification of a risk. The concern is added to the risk register and promptly forgotten about. David emphasizes the need for proactive management of risk as well as understanding that your controls are effective. David comments that “we don't live in a static world, all of the benefits of technology come with risk.”<br /><br /></li><li>A layered approach to cyber risk is essential. Prevention is not the only answer. Regardless of the type of attack, for many organisations having a cyber incident is not about 'if', but 'when'. David says that for most organisations “you're in the situation that 'a breach has already happened you just don't know it yet.” David stresses the fact that “you cannot assume your preventative controls will save you. It's crucial to understand that the faster you can detect and manage an attack, the more you will be able to mitigate the fallout of a breach”. </li></ol>

<p>In this report we take on an age old business dilemma: speed to market and product quality vs. environmental responsibility and public safety. For decades, manufacturers have been trying to find the perfect balance and stay one step ahead of increasing competition. Should profits take priority over ethics? Or, can a profitable equilibrium exist?</p>
<blockquote><p>For manufacturers operating in the auto, food and pharmaceutical industries, the potential impact for human health and life itself can be enormous...
[however] quality issues can often be flagged well before faulty goods are shipped by conducting regular third-party risk assessments of your vendors.</p></blockquote>

<p> </p>
<p>Ransomware is headline news almost every day. The financial model that rewards this new type of cyber criminal has been proven; extorting end-users and enterprises for money works.  The list of organisations impacted is truly mindboggling, from health care networks to corporate systems, government agencies and even law enforcement.<br /><br />
Part of the reason ransomware has been so successful is that the threat hasn't really been taken seriously by many. Defences are usually ad-hoc, overly reliant on specific technologies, and reactive - software is frantically updated when a new ransomware variant hits the headlines. <br /><br />
Classical disaster recovery plans also fail to account for the operational goals of ransomware attackers. Unlike conventional risks that may trigger disaster recovery protocols, ransomware actively seeks to thwart recovery efforts.<br /><br />
So, while it might seem like resistance is futile, the reality is that ransomware attacks can be prevented and business impact can be mitigated. What is needed is a coherent, policy-based approach to defending business assets. <br /><br /><strong>Why now? </strong><br />
The combination of encryption, crypto-currencies and 'dark' networks gives these attackers the ability to lock down critical business resources and to process ransom payments while remaining anonymous.<br /><br />
Consequently, the barrier to entry for a would-be-criminal is quite low. Most ransomware variants are copycat attacks with minor tweaks to either what they target, or how they initiate their infections. Unfortunately, even with minor tweaks, the high frequency of attacks has seen the overall ransomware threat evolve rapidly.<br /><br /><strong>Know thy enemy</strong><br />
To defend against current ransomware threats and help understanding the threat, we should ask: what are the motives of the attacker, and how have their technical capabilities and methods evolved over time?<br /><br />
Knowing what types of data these crooks are likely to be interested in allows us to start developing both defensive mechanism to prevent infection, and appropriate disaster recovery procedures.<br /><br /><strong>Ransom-aware security policies</strong><br />
Security policy development frameworks such as ISO/27000 can help to identify risks, document procedures and develop controls to defend against most ransomware threats. However, your security plan also needs to be “ransom-aware”.<br /><br />
The broad range of at-risk systems and data needs to be considered, and disaster recovery plans need to be secure against deliberate data and backup destruction.<br /><br />
For example: ISO27002-2015 section 12.3 covers implementation guidance for backups. It recommends that: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“…backups should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape and damage from a disaster at the main site.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, if your policies are not “ransom-aware”, they might maintain a physical separation but overlook a network (logical) separation. Under attack from ransomware, you may find that the malware has reached out across your network links to destroy remote or even cloud-based backups.<br /><br /><strong>Business best practice</strong><br />
To combat the threat of ransomware, enterprises need to be prepared. SAI Global's guide ' <a href="//infostore.saiglobal.com/en-au/Standards/GB-206-2017-1925020/" title="Surviving Ransomware">Surviving Ransomware</a>', co-authored by  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zubair-baig-18849a68/" title="Zubair Baig">Zubair Baig</a> and  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-prevent-ransomware-nikolai-hampton?published=t" title="Nikolai Hampton">Nikolai Hampton</a>, is designed to help organisations prepare and it is available now on our <a href="http:////infostore.saiglobal.com/en-au/Standards/GB-206-2017-1925020/" title="online store">online store</a>. It is essential that at-risk systems are identified and either: updated to minimise the attack surface exposed through vulnerabilities and unsupported or obsolete software; or protected through other technical measures such as firewalls or physical isolation.<br /><br />
Security policy controls will also require regular reviews to ensure they adequately consider both current ransomware threats, as well as the potential future evolution.<br /><br />
Special ransomware consideration is required for security controls such as: </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• Access control policies (for both users as well as automated systems),<br />
• Backup procedures (including isolation of backups),<br />
• Disaster recovery procedures,<br />
• Network segregation controls, and<br />
• Incident management<br /><br />
Business should also consider their position on ransomware payments. In an ideal world, payments would never be made and the threat would dry up due to lack of financial incentive. However evidence shows that many corporate and even government agencies have resorted to ransomware payments. Your policies and practices should reflect your appetite for dealing with extortion, acceptable losses, limiting ransom payments and sustaining communication policies.<br /><br /><strong>In summary</strong><br />
The ransomware threat is real, it's growing and it adaptive. While ransomware is unlike most other cyber security and information security threats, enterprises can defend their critical assets through proactive and well-developed security policies. But, these policies must adequately consider the ransomware threat.<br /><br />
With sufficient planning, revised security policy controls and a well-tested disaster recovery plan, protecting against ransomware is possible. All that remains is to remain vigilant and prepared to adapt as the nature of the threat develops across future generations of malware.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry is facing major challenges with the oil price remaining low, the transport sector seeking new electric technology and governments looking to increase their renewable energy allocation. However, safety was a challenge the oil and gas industry had to overcome, and it still remains the biggest threat to the industry; even in these turbulent times. <br /><br />
The industry learnt many lessons in safety, which have led to major advancements including best practice and understanding root cause analysis; lessons all industries now benefit from. <br /><br />
As many businesses now see this as a fundamental board requirement, the oil and gas industry moved into process safety. Process safety drives business improvement the same way incident and accident data improves lives. By utilising software to capture complex data and provide insights, efficiencies can be driven and tested by changes in the industry. However, the management of change, environmental data and predictive indicators are now helping the oil and gas industry to future proof their strategy. </p>
<blockquote><p>Having spent more than five years working with major oil and gas companies, it’s clear to me that the oil and gas industry can teach any business how a robust environmental health and safety process can ensure competitive edge and help future proof the business and also the industry.</p><p>Gareth Lane</p><p>Business development director, EMEA, SAI Global</p></blockquote>In our whitepaper

, expert Gareth Lane discusses the fundamental information needed for businesses to build an enterprise solution strategy for years to come. 
<br />
<br />
<p>Start as the oil and gas industry did; understand how data can help mitigate risk and facilitate business decisions that create competitive edge. Implement a modular approach to address process risk, allowing you to choose the modules that protect your long term interests, keep stakeholders engaged and create positive new initiatives that support your strategy and are supported with data and business intelligence.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The new edition of the Wiring Rules will be revised to include new definitions and changes for additional clarity.</p>
<h5>New performance requirements</h5>
<p>The new Wiring Rules is a complete revision of the 2007 edition to provide updated work methods and installation practices that are 'deemed to comply' with the associated performance outcomes and safety conditions.</p>
<p>It specifies the minimum set of electrical safety rules and requirements for the design, construction and testing of electrical installations in all Australian and New Zealand premises.</p>
<h5>Who needs a copy to comply?</h5>
<p>Everyone involved in electrical installations:</p>
<ul><li>Electricians</li><li>Electrical contractors</li><li>Design consultants</li><li>Inspectors and regulators</li><li>Electrical industry training bodies</li><li>Manufacturers</li><li>Importers</li><li>Retailers and wholesalers</li><li>Electricity distributors.</li></ul>
<h5>Key changes</h5>
<ul><li>More information on mandatory test failures and continuity of the installation's earthing system</li><li>Mandatory RCD requirements for protected circuits and alterations and repairs clarified</li><li>Improved installation safety requirements for cables that pass through bulk thermal insulation</li><li>New clause detailing Arc Fault Detection Devices and installation requirements</li><li>Enhanced requirements for switchboard installation and minimum clearances</li><li>New electric vehicle socket outlet requirements</li><li>Revised requirements for lighting equipment and accessories</li><li>New requirements for electrical equipment that may produce hot particles or hot surfaces</li><li>Improved safety requirements for cooking appliance switching devices</li><li>Gas appliances and equipment isolation requirements clarified</li><li>New installation requirements for each type of safety service</li><li>Installation requirements for electricity generation systems updated in line with applicable standards</li><li>The date of initial energisation is now mandatory at the installation switchboard</li><li>New figures added and existing figures updated to further assist the industry.</li></ul>
<h5>Still in two parts</h5>
<p>With over 200 proposed changes, the new Wiring Rules will remain in two parts in a single volume:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Part One</strong> outlines the fundamental safety principles and provides an 'outcomes oriented' approach to allow flexibility in design.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Part Two</strong> details 'deemed to comply' solutions for the majority of electrical installation work and includes explanatory diagrams and technical requirements.</li><li style="list-style: none;"><p> </p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP228?id=0" class="sai-call-to-action sai-red-button" style="padding: 15px 50px; color: white !important;">REGISTER NOW</a></div></li></ul>

Now more than ever before, a legal practice is a business that needs to be competitive and profitable, while providing a professional service that not just satisfies but also delights clients. The Head of Marketing &amp; Brand of DAS UK has recently said that 'Delighting and exceeding your clients' expectations will invariably generate a stronger 'client bond' leading to more retained work, more word-of-mouth referrals and more profit per equity partner.'[2]<br /><br />
We all agree that inefficiencies create dissatisfaction, and inefficiencies are unproductive. This is indeed true in legal practice management. Having to jump through hoops just to find the one transfer form or property certificate you need is frustrating. It disrupts workflow, and it slows you down. And that's bad news. You see, all businesses have workflow. Workflow gets things done. What's more is that your time, effort and energy is much better spent elsewhere, such as on making progress in a transaction, servicing (delighting!) a client, and generating billable work.<br /><br />
In our hearts, we know there is a better way. Nowadays, innovation in technology can be <em>the</em> solution to our problems. The Law Society of New South Wales's 2017 FLIP ('Future of Law and Innovation in the Profession') report[3] shows that innovation can have a great impact on the practice of law. Innovation in legal practice management software certainly can help eliminate inefficiencies.<br /><br />
If you think your practice may be too small to need practice management software, think again. Law Technology Today, published by the American Bar Association's Legal Technology Resource Center, gave this example in an article [4] earlier this year when they explored the topic of practice management software for solo and small firm lawyers - if you have a small firm with lots of paper files, you should assess the risks to your practice if your office caught on fire. Thinking more broadly, if you are manually keeping track of deadlines, or if you are housing documents such as contracts in paper files or if you are scanning them to store on your hard drive, then how can you be sure that you are effectively managing risks, or protecting your data from damage, loss or theft? Technology can be utilised to better manage information, and even help you go paperless, regardless of firm size.<br /><br />
And if you think you don't have the time or the resources to make changes, let's consider whether you actually have time to continue working the way you do now. This is food for thought. Do you physically extract information from different documents in order to create reports for internal use or to provide status updates to clients? Automation is possible with the help of legal practice management software. This can transform and streamline a practice by ensuring every step in the matter cycle is completed on time and error free, billed, audited and tracked with the highest levels of accuracy and compliance.<br /><br />
A recent Lawyers Weekly cover story on the 'rebooting' of the legal profession reported that for law firms, the 'big wins' of embracing technology include increased client retention rates, flexibility and employee satisfaction, together with the ability to offer a more effective and efficient way of doing business. So you want a piece of the 'big wins'. But there are so many legal practice management software out there for lawyers to choose from - how do you choose? Here's a shopping list to help you get started. When looking for legal practice management software, consider the following:<br />
  </p>
<ol><li><strong>Does it provide secure storage?</strong> Transaction data and client information must be 'parked' securely. This also helps with compliance with record keeping obligations.</li><li><strong>Is there easy access?</strong> There is no point storing something securely but it is hard to find when you need it. Instant 24/7 retrieval is the gold standard.</li><li><strong>Is there the ability to share?</strong> If you can securely share things such as mortgage documents and settlement figures with whom you wish to collaborate with, then working together towards achieving a common goal (be it service excellence or practice sustainability) is well within reach.</li><li><strong>Can it track?</strong> For example, can it act as your virtual assistant and alert you to important dates so you will never miss a deadline? Some practice areas, such as conveyancing, are packed full of tight deadlines. You cannot risk not settling on time - this will be the complete opposite of delighting the client!</li><li><strong>Does it have the reporting capabilities you need?</strong> The ability to generate accurate reports is key to many things, including trust accounting - there are stringent laws concerning the receipt, holding and disbursement of money held on behalf of a client or other people in the course of, or in connection with, the provision of legal services.</li><li><strong>Last but definitely not least - does it automate?</strong> Let's use the trust accounting example again. Software that has built-in banking workflows to automatically prepare deposits, disbursements and reconciliations so you can manage trust accounts from receipt to disbursement is attractive, and even practitioners who are conservative adopters of technologies will want to implement this practical solution.</li></ol>

<sup>(1).</sup>
<p><br /><b>Benefits of a good legal practice management system<br /></b><br />
Did you know that practice management software has existed for the better part of 20 years?<sup>(2)</sup> Practice management software exists for a good reason. Professor Jared Correia from Suffolk University Law School, who is also the CEO of Red Cave Law Firm Consulting in Boston, said that a legal practice management software system can be the principal organising feature of a law firm, a full-scale repository and collaboration tool, and a hedge against malpractice. <sup>(3)</sup> This is no exaggeration when we look at just three of the many benefits of a good practice management system:<br /><br /><b>1. Increase in productivity</b><br /><br />
Manual processes take twice as long to perform workflow management, legal research and document production tasks, and 25 per cent longer for time tracking, cost ledgering and document management tasks. <sup>(4)</sup> Imagine how much more efficient you can be if you have a tool that automates workflow, document and time sheet management to ensure each activity in the life of a matter is accurately completed, billed, audited and tracked. A good practice management system improves your efficiency, and this increases your productivity. <br /><br /><b>2. Better approach to business</b><br /><br />
Let us take a closer look at time sheet management and controls around the billing of professional fees and disbursements. Research shows that 56% of lawyers who rely on manual processes to record time significantly under-estimate the time each job takes.<sup>(5)</sup> A lawyer who fails to record and bill all time means the law firm cannot invoice the client, and this means the law firm does not get paid. The same goes with disbursements. The same research shows that 50% of lawyers under-estimate pass-on client costs. If you do not record and charge all disbursements, then you cannot recoup your outlay. All these are not good for business, including the business of law. Practice management software with automated systems and controls will help you do better business.<br /><br /><b>3. Better compliance<br /></b><br />
John Mitchell, Chief Trust Account Investigator and Supervisor of the Law Society of New South Wales, noted that the failure to complete monthly trial balances and bank reconciliations represented the highest breach recorded by External Examiners in the 2016 External Examiners Reports.<sup>(6)</sup>  He pointed out that, by simply not doing trial balances and bank reconciliations within 15 days of month end, lawyers are exposed. Would you like to manage trust accounting functions on one platform to have full visibility? Would you like to have built-in banking workflows that automatically prepare deposits, disbursements and reconciliations, so you can manage trust accounts from receipt to disbursement? The answer of course is yes, and there are practice management software systems that can achieve that.<br /><br /><b>Integration - look out for this key area of functionality<br /></b><br />
The Queensland Law Society has identified that a main area of functionality that a practice management system offers is integration - integration with other products and devices as well as other functionality.  <br /><br />
Integration can take many forms. For lawyers who operate in specialist practice areas such conveyancing, the kind of integration you want includes a digital 'gateway' that allows you to perform high-volume, complex searches for your clients in a way that is fully incorporated into your internal workflow and billing platforms. True integration is not just a link that connects A and B for you. By way of example, true integration will allow a search function (for property and commercial searches) and your practice management application to form into one and operate as a whole. This means you will have a faster, more accurate, and more efficient workflow, because, among many other things, you will be in control to easily bill and recover costs from clients for search tasks that you perform on their behalf.<br /><br />
So, here is a hot tip for those who are looking to invest in a good legal practice management software system: what do you want when it comes to integration? Look for a service provider who offers true integration, not anything less.<br /><br />
A good practice management system is your strategic business partner. <br /><br />

<p> </p>
<p>It's often considered a taboo word. Bad. Downside. Negative. But it doesn't have to be.  It's mired in negativity because along with it typically comes poor outcomes, like losses, missed opportunities, or worse.  But what's the real reason? Is it because of risk?  Or is it because of a <i>lack of preparedness around risk?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h5>Simple answers for simple questions</h5>
<p>Today, when we want simple answers, we use Google, Bing, or even Alexa. Peck out or shout out a question (“What's the weather like today?” , “By how many points did the New England Patriots win?”), and our digital friends chirp us an answer.  Simple questions, simple answers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But when questions are more nuanced and complex, these sources fail. Complex questions aren't suited for algorithms, they're suited for people. In times like this, I head to Quora. I can ask it those nuanced and complex questions that get answered by humans, who are often experts on the matter at hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5>We need a Quora for the C-Suite</h5>
<p>As you well know, juggling multiple high-risk decisions in the executive boardroom of a company is no match for Alexa or Bing.  We need something better. We need Quora. We need our <i>own</i> Quora. Thankfully, we've done the heavy lifting and <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP570" title="assembled something like a 'Quora for risk in the C-Suite' here. For you.">assembled something like a 'Quora for risk in the C-Suite' here. For you.</a></p>

Their executive-level presence and experience positioned them well to take on these challenging questions. Why these questions? Because we know these are the questions being asked behind closed doors in board rooms and on retreats. We know these are the complex questions with no clear-cut answer (otherwise, you'd use Google!). And we know that true business leaders don't shoot from the hip - they seek counsel and advice to make sound decisions.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>This development is more than a technology platform.  It is a network working together in an electronic environment governed by the regulatory framework agreed by all of the Registrars at ARNECC and signed off in consultation with industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In signing up for PEXA, you need to already be able to comply with the Model Participation Rules (MPR) at the time of applying to be a Subscriber, comply with the Participation Rules whilst being a subscriber and continue to comply with certain Participation Rules even after ceasing to be a Subscriber.  This is Clause 3 in the MPR.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In working with many conveyancing professionals around the country, there are varying degrees of awareness of the MPR even among those who are already transacting, and that is a little concerning.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reason the MPR exists is to ensure that the trusted network of participants can have confidence that everyone is doing their part to keep the system safe and ensure that the integrity of the land registries, that we all rely on, is maintained. </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>No matter where you are on the path - the time to be familiar with your compliance obligations and how you are implementing them in your business to the highest quality, is now.</p><p>Amanda Baker</p><p>Head of Industry Development, SAI Global Property</p></blockquote><p><b><i>So what does this mean on a practical basis, how you do this?

Each post will shine the spotlight on a different member of the E&C community, from established CCOs and CECOs with years of experience to rising stars with a passion for ethical behavior. To be featured in your own Six Questions interview, email sean.freidlin@saiglobal.com to get started. </p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/6%20(23).png?n=7217" /></div><p><strong>Q1: How long have you been working in ethics and compliance? </strong><br /><br />
In one way or another, I've been working in ethics and compliance for almost 13 years. Since late 2013, I've been privileged to serve as the Global Director of Kennametal's Office of Ethics and Compliance.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Q2: What did you want to be when you were growing up? </strong><br /><br />
Great question! Unlike most lawyers I know (or perhaps even some compliance practitioners), I didn't grow up wanting to practice law or run a corporate compliance program. My initial plan was to be either an engineer or a chemist. I'm a bit of a science and technology geek at heart. My plans changed when I was exposed to the legal and compliance world during a summer internship between my junior and senior years of undergraduate college. I fell in love with compliance that summer. From there, I went off to law school and into a career working on ethics and compliance issues for global companies. The rest is history!</p>
<p><br /><strong>Q3: What are some of the most rewarding and challenging parts of your job?</strong><br /><br />
By far the most rewarding part of my job is helping people to see that ethics and compliance is not just the right thing to do, but that it also directly supports the sustainable near and long-term growth of the organization. People and customers want to work for and buy from companies with integrity and purpose. I get recharged each time I have the privilege of watching this transformation in a colleague.</p>
<br />
<p>The most challenging part of my job is to continuously adjust ethics and compliance programs to respond to the ever-changing legal and enforcement landscape, and evolving business strategies and markets, and to ensure that we effectively prepare our team members for the challenges they will face. I learned long ago that the ethics and compliance field requires you to be nimble because the pace of change is not slowing down.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Q4: What are three important traits a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer should possess</strong></p>
<ol><li><strong>Unwavering integrity</strong> - Without integrity, a CCO has no credibility and cannot lead<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Stellar communication skills</strong> - At least 50% of what I do each day depends on my ability to effectively communicate an idea, concept, or program.  Whether I'm talking to our shop-floor employees, executive team, or briefing my Board of Directors, communication is everything (a very close second behind integrity).<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Resourcefulness</strong> - A CCO must be adept at leveraging the talents, processes, and commitment of other functions within their organization to drive an effective ethics and compliance program. I firmly believe ethics and compliance is a team sport and the majority of the 'team' I rely upon is outside of my chain of command. This is particularly true in my work at Kennametal, which has a far-flung global footprint that necessitates me partnering with colleagues in other functions and geographies to ensure we have effective programs in all corners of the company.</li></ol>
<p><br /><strong>Q5: If someone wanted to get more involved in promoting ethical behavior in their organization today, what could they do? <br /><br /></strong> I have a number of thoughts on this question, but at the most basic level, I believe every team member, regardless of their role or level within the organization, has not only the capability but also the responsibility to drive an ethical culture within their organization. It's about committing yourself to doing things the right way, counseling your peers and team members to do the same, and having the self-awareness to speak up when you need help.</p>
<br />
<p>Beyond this, I would encourage you to seek out the leaders and advocates for the ethics and compliance programs at your organization to see how you can get more formally involved, such as through an ombudsman or ethics advocate role.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Q6: What advice would you give to recent college graduates and other professionals who may want to pursue a career in ethics and compliance?</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p>Ethics and compliance is an exciting and growing field and one where you can make a tangible difference. There are boundless opportunities, but be prepared to be a life-long learner and embrace change at every turn.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Bonus Q: How do you cut through all the communication 'noise' to effectively train your employees on ethics and compliance topics?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong>I spend a lot of time thinking about this topic. The amount and pace of communications inside and outside the workplace has changed dramatically in the last 5 to 10 years. A huge part of an effective ethics and compliance program is the ability to train people on the key information they need to navigate the ethical and legal minefields they encounter in their daily work. My experience is that regardless of how long someone has been in the workplace, the expectation of concise, impactful, and actionable training must be part of any CCO's thought process.</p>
<p>Today's workforce is inundated with communication from all sides. An effective CCO needs to cut through that crowded communications space to grab their audience's attention and deliver an impactful and practical message. I only see this becoming more important over time.</p>

Each post will shine the spotlight on a different member of the E&amp;C community, from established CCOs and CECOs with years of experience to rising stars with a passion for ethical behavior.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Q1: How long have you been working in ethics and compliance? </b></p>
<br />
<p>I've been working in this area, in some form or another, for over 10 years. </p>
<b><br />
Q2: What did you want to be when you were growing up? </b>
<br />
<br />
<p>As a kid, I used to ask my family for office supplies and stationary for Christmas. Things like rubber stamps, paperclips, staplers, and sticky notes. I have no idea why I found them so appealing, but as crazy as it sounds, I remember thinking I wanted a job where I could use them often. So, I guess being a Chief Compliance Officer fits that description! </p>
<br />
<p><b>Q3: What are some of the most rewarding and challenging parts of your job?  </b></p>
<br />
<p>One of the most rewarding parts of being in-house is the exposure to how a business operates; everything from finance to sales to manufacturing, R&amp;D, and human resources. The best compliance professionals make it a priority to really understand how their company functions internally, and in the market, so that they can design internal controls that actually make sense from a practical point of view and are an asset to the business. </p>
<br />
<p>These aren't things you typically learn in law school, at least not during my time, so it can be a challenge for some people coming from that background. I'm grateful that I've been able to develop a certain degree of business acumen as part of my job. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Q4: What are three important traits a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer should possess? </b></p>
<br />
<p>Among many other traits, a CCO or CECO should have strong leadership skills, the ability to persuade others, and should be well-informed about business trends and emerging risks that may affect the company. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Q5: If someone wanted to get more involved in promoting ethical behavior in their organization today, what could they do? </b></p>
<br />
<p>Two easy ways to do this would be to: </p>
<p>1. lead by example, especially if your role involves managing other people. </p>
<p>2. work with your compliance team to understand how you can incorporate their message and resources into the way you execute your job responsibilities on a consistent basis. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Q6: What advice would you give to recent college graduates and other professionals who may want to pursue a career in ethics and compliance? </b></p>
<br />
<p>In a nutshell, be resourceful. Go online and research what it really means to be a compliance and ethics professional so you are aware of what this job entails and what skills are required. Read about people who have experienced success in this field and study their career paths so you can start charting yours. And use your network to connect to people who can help you achieve the next step in that path.<br />

<p> </p>
<p>Looking at information available on AustLII, in 2015, there were 2 “extension of time” cases decided by the courts. In 2016, there were 4. As at October 2017, there were already 10. In order to learn from these cases, let us start with what the law says.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While it is not mandatory to register a security interest under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (PPS Act), and there is no general time limit for making a registration, section 588FL of Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) provides that where a security interest is given by a company and is perfected by registration only, it will vest in the company on insolvency if it has been registered for less than 6 months, unless the security interest is registered within 20 business days after the security agreement came into force. Under section 588FM of the Corporations Act, a court may “cure” the secured interest by extending the time for registration, if it is satisfied that the failure to register the security interest earlier was accidental, due to inadvertence, due to some other sufficient cause, or the failure is not of such a nature as to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. A court may also make the order if it will be just and equitable to grant the relief.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In <em>Re Amotran</em>, the court had to consider a technical question relating to notice (whether notice of the application ought to be given to anyone). Perhaps a more practical and relevant lesson for us in <em>Re Amotran</em> relates to the fact that the court accepted the applicant's explanation for its failure to properly register its security was due to inadvertence, and that the application has been brought promptly, once the error was discovered. Looking at this and the many earlier “extension of time” cases, if a secured party did not register a security interest within the prescribed timeframes by error, it should act quickly to apply to the court for an extension of time to make the registration. It would assist the application if it could, among other things, demonstrate that the late registration would not affect any other accrued or accruing rights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More importantly, secured parties should always perfect a security interest as soon as possible by observing the prescribed timeframes. Early and timely registration will minimise the risk of having an unperfected security interest that is subject to any “vesting risk”.</p>

Incorporating eLearning into flights has shown to be a highly beneficial practice.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">The eLearning community cruises to new heights by taking cues from the airline industry</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/SAI%20-%20eLearning%20at%2035000%20feet.jpg?n=8210" /></div><p><strong>By Rebecca Turco, Vice President of Learning, SAI Global</strong></p>
<p>I recently traveled with a colleague to an off-site meeting and it seemed like the whole plane was doing the same, squeezing one or two more flights in before the end of the year. You could tell who they were. The seasoned business travelers knew where to place bags, how to negotiate overhead bin space and strategically slide a laptop or iPad into the seat pocket for in-flight work. This is all second-nature for the road warriors, myself included.</p>
<p>As the flight attendants worked through their typical pre-flight script, practically no one was paying attention: calls finishing, headphones at the ready, settling in for the flight. And when it came to the safety announcement, I only paid attention to see who wasn't paying attention. It used to be the same bored monotony of a person speaking above conversation volume, miming procedures to follow in case of emergency. The likelihood of the scenario was the same. The order in which you should affix your own oxygen mask before helping others, the same. Could there be another way, retiring corporate videos flickering away on seat-back video screens?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Chicken or Beef?</h3>
<p>I've traveled a lot for work and I've seen these demonstrations evolve, with some attendants inserting their own personality (how many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07LFBydGjaM" title="flight attendants get applause after delivering the standard information?">flight attendants get applause after delivering the standard information?</a>). While highly entertaining and effective, this isn't repeatable and can't be scaled.  But what if you turned it on its head? What if you radically changed the delivery of the safety information to make it interesting? Engaging? Could airline safety videos actually be worth watching?</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="source: Hilarious Southwest Flight Attendant (24M views)" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/eLearning%20at%2035000%20feet%20-%20southwest.png" /></div><h3>Flip The Script</h3>
<p>Take Air New Zealand as an example.  Buckling a seatbelt, affixing an oxygen mask … <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA33IAf23-8" title="as instructed by Katie Holmes and Cuba Gooding Junior?!">as instructed by Katie Holmes and Cuba Gooding Junior?!</a> Featuring music performed by a New Zealand artist? And real New Zealand locations?</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="source: Fantastical Journey - #AirNZSafetyVideo" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/eLearning%20at%2035000%20feet%20-%20anz.png" /></div><p>Now this is something worth watching!  Faces I recognize, upbeat music, fantastical sights.  Other airlines are getting on board, too.  British Airways built on this concept and produced a video incorporating world-famous stars and striking the balance between serious and funny. They use the humor to get your attention, and then hit you with necessary information. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCoQwZ9BQ9Q" title="They produced a “Director's Cut”, showing 'outtakes' from the final video.">They produced a “Director's Cut”, showing 'outtakes' from the final video.</a> Is it engaging? You bet. From July 2017, it's earned 7.9M+ YouTube views.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="source: British Airways safety video - director's cut" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/eLearning%20at%2035000%20feet%20-%20ba.png" /></div><p>So what's different here? The same information is conveyed, but you're smiling along, associating a brand with something new and interesting. You are engaged by the content , and … you are learning.</p>
<h3>The Effect of Engagement on eLearning</h3>
<p>When information like this is rote, it becomes mundane and, to a large extent, ineffective.  The same is true of required learning for your workforce. If the lessons are the same, the delivery mechanism unchanged, and there's no variability in content, length, applicability, then efficacy will drop.</p>
<p>Air New Zealand, British Airways, and others found a way through. Engage the customer. Invite them into the message. Learning should be fun - even for the most serious of topics, like airline safety or workplace compliance. </p>
<p>Recorded videos can scale beyond that of live delivery, but they aren't personal. We're getting there with in-flight personalization, though. KLM allows you to <a href="https://www.klm.com/travel/us_en/prepare_for_travel/on_board/your_seat_on_board/meet_and_seat.htm">network in the air</a>, by offering you the option (not a requirement) to share your Facebook, Google+, or LinkedIn profile for your flight to network with fellow passengers.</p>
<p>What if KLM (or any other airline) took that information one step further, and segmented one of a handful of custom in-flight safety eLearning videos that matched your profile? What if your total miles traveled (seasoned veteran vs. rookie) or seat location (re: exit location) could be factored into the learning experience? Imagine how much more relevant and applicable that information could be.  Instead of “the nearest exit may be behind you”, it's turned into “the nearest exit is behind you, but you already know that, from flying with us more than 15 times last year.”</p>
<p>What if instead of passive learning, the airlines turned it into active learning? What if there was some sort of interactivity, like the trivia quiz games that are available on so many airlines? Instead of movie and Hollywood trivia, the airlines could quiz passengers on the best response in the event of certain in-flight activities to increase participation and attention.</p>
<p>Passengers lean in. They take notice. They participate. They learn.</p>
<p>A reward system could be set up fairly easily: an extra snack, priority boarding on a next flight, bonus miles. Some of these rewards are peanuts (sorry, couldn't resist) for airlines to offer. <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/23-effective-uses-gamification-in-learning-part-2">We can incentivize participation through competition, acknowledgement, and rewards.</a> We can engage the learner with emotions, interactions and game-design elements to make the learning sticky so that retention and recall are much higher than traditional elearning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There's no denying the appetite for online learning or eLearning. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> alone has delivered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy#International_reach">over one billion lessons worldwide, and the platform is used by 40 million students and two million teachers every month</a>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Lesson Plan, Today</h3>
<p>The way we learn has changed.  We are bombarded with information. And that information is competing with shorter attention spans, our own personal devices, today's “always on” workplace environment, and a desire (nay, a need) to unplug.  Boring, one-size-fits-all safety videos will increasingly get lost in the noise.</p>
<p>What about that mandated e-learning you have to do at work?  How engaging is that?  How entertaining?  Same input, same output.  The lesson plan needs to change. Things like rewarding learners who attain the knowledge of the risk and test out of the training.  Or simulated branching experiences where learners drive their learning path. Or bite-sized learning broken down into three- to five-minute content chunks that allow learners to access the experience when they want to.  </p>
<p>What if we answered a series of questions, about our role within the organization, location, office/work-from-home, tenure, learning style, management responsibilities, and the like?  Think of this as the creation of your learning profile, and, once complete, your profile-based learning experiences are now served up to you in a personalized emotional manner, a manner where you receive content and learning experiences that are relevant to you.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I've never experienced a flight emergency or a water landing. I'd feel much safer knowing the people to my left and right know exactly what to do, though, because in times of crisis, you have no choice but to depend on the people around you. Imagine feeling that confident about the people you interact with everyday at work.</p>

<p>I consider my start in ethics and compliance to be about 15 years ago when I was involved in the litigation of employment law and securities fraud cases. Right about that time, Sarbanes Oxley was enacted and I began to see a path in what is now ethics and compliance. I see employment law's view of company policies, programs, and reporting options for harassment claims as mitigation and defense options as the precursor to current ethics and compliance programs. </p>
<p><strong>Q2: What did you want to be when you were growing up? </strong></p>
<p>At 5, I wanted to be a ballerina. At 10, a mom. At 20, a lawyer. And today, I want to be (and am blessed and fortunate to have the role) a Chief Compliance Officer for a healthcare company. </p>
<p><strong>Q3: What are some of the most rewarding and challenging parts of your job? </strong></p>
<p>The most rewarding parts are when I can contribute a practical solution to a problem and help the business do the important work of creating diagnostics in the healthcare space. I also find it incredibly rewarding when my team's work is acknowledged as practical, helpful, and fun. The most challenging part of my job is the sheer volume and variety of issues I touch on any given day. </p>
<p><strong>Q4: What are three important traits a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer should possess? </strong></p>
<ul><li>An interest in lifelong learning</li><li>Integrity</li><li>Stick-to-itiveness </li></ul>
<p><strong>Q5: If someone wanted to get more involved in promoting ethical behavior in their organization today, what could they do? </strong></p>
<p>As one of my favorite quotes reads, <em>"Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can."</em></p>
<ul><li>Learn about the current company program.</li><li>Read up on hot topics in the field, within and outside the industry your company is in.</li><li>Engage with the compliance officer and other senior leaders who are "in charge" of the program and offer ideas or suggestions, or just volunteer to help with the program. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Q6: What advice would you give to recent college graduates and other professionals who may want to pursue a career in ethics and compliance? </strong></p>
<p>This is a great, growing field, and it continues to evolve and become more robust and important. I find it incredibly meaningful and rewarding. I suggest that people get certified as Compliance and Ethics Professionals as soon as possible and read the various publications and blogs to stay current as the regulations are changing fast and furiously. </p>

With SAI Global&#39;s expert insight, you can stay on top of risk management trends.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">Your compass for the next 12 months</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/GettyImages-639636520.jpg" /></div><p>The E&amp;C and GRC industries will experience the most disruption in their short history in 2018. As organizations strain to keep pace with the cultural and regulatory impact on risk management, ethics and compliance, and corporate culture this year, we will see a reactive and proactive evolution in the programs adopted to meet these new challenges and opportunities. </p>
<p>Reactively, organizations will acknowledge the need to evolve how they measure the effectiveness of their ethics, compliance, and risk programs. Proactively, we anticipate significant regulatory, technological, and cultural trends that will force organizations to adapt and adjust how they plan to affect and model behavior change across all organizational levels. </p>
<p>Increased awareness around sexual misconduct will undeniably force organizations to look at their cultures, how they handle whistleblowing claims, and how they govern employees' social media use. The prominence and rising value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the looming presence of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May, will change how ethics and compliance departments educate their colleagues on key risk areas. </p>
<h2><strong>Here are SAI Global's ethics and compliance, corporate culture, and risk management trends &amp; predictions for 2018: </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<ol><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/risk/ethics_and_compliance/" title="Ethics and compliance programs">Ethics and compliance programs</a> will make a significant leap in user experience and user interface. Programs will continue to evolve into more personalized experiences for employees and adopt elements from mainstream technology, like curation and playlists similar to what we see in Netflix, Spotify, and Apple Music.<br />
 </li><li>Whistleblowers in organizations around the world will feel empowered to speak up more than ever throughout 2018, knowing they have support from the global community and media. Companies will need to react to this trend by putting in place protocols and processes to handle accusations at a much larger scale than ever before, while also evaluating if their employees trust these processes enough to come forward and speak up without the fear of retaliation. <br /><br /></li><li>Increasing dialogue relating to sexual harassment and misconduct will force organizations to look beyond training programs on these topics to a more comprehensive and culture-centric approach to changing behavior. <br /><br /></li><li>In light of the attention on unethical corporate behavior and the growing importance of culture and values as a differentiator, members of the C-suite will spend the next twelve months establishing themselves as ethical leaders and role models for their industry peers. <br /><br /></li><li>Organizations will change their definition of 'program effectiveness' and look to developing a deeper understanding of culture and behavior. A more accurate, holistic and universal way of measuring behavior, culture, risk, and compliance in organizations will seek to answer the question: is what we're doing actually working; and how can we change it if it's not? <br /><br /></li><li>The effects of the EU's GDPR will reach far and wide across all industries and geographies. This new regulation will be especially influential for Facebook, Twitter, and other prolific, global media companies that rely so much on user data for customized experiences and targeted advertising. <br /><br /></li><li>The first formal Bitcoin regulation will be passed in 2018, but not before at least one prominent news story of high-stakes cryptocurrency-fueled bribery or corruption makes major headlines. Organizations will begin to incorporate training around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-bribery and anti-corruption (ABAC) ethics and compliance programs. <br /><br /></li><li>This will be the year of a unified approach to risk. We'll see fundamental changes to the design and intent of internal governance structures within organizations. Deeper investment into resources and technology will help create a connected view of risk across all departments, such as cloud-based risk management solutions. </li></ol>
<p>The urgency and necessity of risk and compliance functions working together, and the role those functions play in the C-suite, will force movement in both human and technology-driven innovation to succeed in today's environment. Technology has changed our behavior and will continue to push organizations to leverage new tools to help drive and measure outcomes, both cultural and regulatory. </p>
<p>We'll face these challenges together and will share more of our thoughts on these topics in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Advances in ethics and compliance training technology and learning management systems (LMS), as well as a growing maturity within ethics and compliance (E&amp;C) programs, implies that, in 2018, Chief Compliance Officers will have more data and insights into their programs than ever before. This will help compliance officers learn more about what does and doesn't work in their programs, and what resonates with their employees.</p>
<p>While a growing focus on data and analytics is not a completely new trend, it is an increasingly important one worth highlighting as we look at the next twelve months. More and more, organizations are looking for relevant metrics and powerful analytics that better calibrate their E&amp;C practices and risk governance strategies, as well as an increase in the impact of their interventions. The trend demands access to insightful data, predictive analytics, smart dashboards, and comprehensive data architectures. </p>
<p>The constant need to collect data that helps quantify program effectiveness has made strides in the right direction but, compliance officers are still not measuring everything they can or making the most of the data they collect. The notion of program effectiveness and impact is evolving, and with that evolution, accelerated internal pressures stemming from the increased attention placed on corporate culture and compliance training in light of recent scandals and media coverage. </p>
<p>We know that we need training and learning solutions to do more than just increase an employee's basic levels of knowledge and understanding. To truly change behavior, what they learn needs to be supported by context, emphasized by leadership, reinforced in conversation, and driven home by a cultural focus on ethics, values, and doing what's right. If we can agree on that, then it's time to think about how we measure more than just the effectiveness of programs, because the program alone is not what changes the behavior. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Homepage_1400_525_text_notext_nologo(1).jpg" /></div><blockquote><p>"In making behavioral sciences part of its anti-corruption strategy, the U.K. is taking a more sophisticated, thorough approach to understanding what is driving the behavior. It is making it a priority...and leading by example; if the government is looking at behavior, it will expect the same from companies."</p><p>Amanda Raad</p><p>Partner at Ropes & Gray </p></blockquote><p>Earlier this year, Richard H. Thaler, a professor and author whose bestselling book "Nudge" focused on human behavior and decision making, won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Why does this matter? <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2017/12/19/the-morning-risk-report-u-k-enlists-behavioral-sciences-to-fight-corruption/" title="As reported by the Wall Street Journal">As reported by the Wall Street Journal</a>, Thaler's work with the UK's Behavioral Insights Team has led to the British government adding behavioral sciences research to their anti-corruption efforts and compliance innovation initiatives. </p>
<p>The recently published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-anti-corruption-strategy-2017-to-2022" title="United Kingdom Anti-Corruption Strategy 2017-2022">United Kingdom Anti-Corruption Strategy 2017-2022</a> details the government's vision and priorities for combating corruption. A significant part of the plan is to apply behavioral sciences to anti-corruption, and, to accomplish that goal, the British government is partnering with governments in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina to support research projects that will test how this approach can be applied to supply chain, third party relationships, and reporting. </p>
<p>As our understanding of human behavior and what motivates corruption and unethical acts continues to grow, even more attention is being paid to the impact this knowledge can have on ethics and compliance programs. Rules alone cannot achieve what needs to be done, because rules are made to be broken. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>OUR PREDICTION</strong></h2>
<p>In 2018, we'll see organizations change their perception around 'program effectiveness' and look at developing a deeper understanding of culture and behavior. Advanced ethics and compliance departments will look beyond program analytics, which simply measure various aspects of the training and content that is delivered to their employees. Instead, these departments will look to a deeper and more meaningful set of analytics and data that looks to measure behavior and how that behavior impacts the company. </p>
<p>Just as training alone cannot change employee behavior, program effectiveness alone cannot truly reflect if employee behavior is changing in a positive way. As part of this trend, training and advisory solutions that are actually able to affect behavior will become key culture drivers. </p>
<p>As this trend becomes more endemic, organizations will be faced with the challenge of managing the confidentiality and anonymity of the data they access. Solutions that guarantee transparency, stick to their intended use, and avoid focusing on individual records will be better suited to deliver insights free of ethical breaches. </p>

The data breach Australia scheme aims to give increased confidence to individuals that if they&#39;re affected by a data breach, they&#39;ll know they&#39;re affected and have a chance to protect their interests.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">Australia’s privacy legislation is being overhauled, with the introduction of new protections designed for the digital age. From 22 February, the new laws – which place data breach notification obligations on some organisations – start operating. </p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/116053_Mandatory_data_breach_banners_Blog_640x340.png?n=1623" /></div><p><strong>1. The notifiable data breaches scheme is law</strong></p>
<p>The Australian Parliament passed laws to introduce a mandatory data breach notification scheme last year, and from 22 February 2018 these laws will start operating.</p>
<p><strong>2. Increased confidence in a digital world is the aim</strong></p>
<p>Like other similar schemes throughout the world, Australia's data breach notification scheme aims to give increased confidence to individuals that if they're affected by a data breach, they'll know they're affected and have a chance to protect their interests.</p>
<p><strong>3. The scheme only applies to certain organisations</strong></p>
<p>The new laws amend the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00283">Australian Privacy Act 1988</a> and apply to organisations governed by that Act. These organisations include Australian Government agencies, businesses and not-for-profit organisations with an annual turnover of $3 million or more, credit reporting bodies, health service providers, and TFN recipients.</p>
<p><strong>4. “Eligible data breaches” trigger the obligation to notify</strong></p>
<p>The new laws provide that an eligible data breach happens when:</p>
<ul><li>there is unauthorised access to, unauthorised disclosure of, or loss of, personal information held by an entity, and</li><li>a reasonable person would conclude that the access, disclosure or loss is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates.</li></ul>
<p>Whether the access, disclosure or loss is likely to result in serious harm depends on the circumstances of the breach including the nature or sensitivity of the information, whether the information is protected by security measures and who could obtain access to the information.</p>
<p>If an eligible data breach occurs, you must prepare a statement for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and, where practicable, take reasonable steps to notify the contents of that statement to each of those affected by the data breach, or if that is not practicable, publish and publicise a copy of the statement on your website. </p>
<p>If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe an eligible data breach has occurred, the Commissioner can also direct that a notification be made.</p>
<p><strong>5. If you suspect a breach you must investigate it</strong></p>
<p>If there are reasonable grounds to suspect an eligible data breach may have occurred, but you are not aware that the circumstances amount to an eligible data breach the notification obligation doesn't immediately arise. However, a "reasonable and expeditious" assessment into the relevant circumstances must be conducted within 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>6. It pays to be proactive</strong></p>
<p>The notification requirements can be avoided if, when a breach is detected, remedial action is taken before serious harm occurs.</p>
<p><strong>7. Beware: severe penalties may apply</strong></p>
<p>Failure to comply with the scheme can mean you're interfering with the privacy of an individual - something which can attract a fine of up to $2.1 million under the privacy legislation.</p>
<br />
<p>Understanding these changes will not just help you comply with the new regime; for businesses with European customers, this is also a step towards understanding and complying with the more stringent European General Data Protection Regulation which commences in May.</p>

Established to commemorate the 1981 passing of Convention 108, the first legally binding privacy and data protection international treaty, Data Privacy Day this year comes on eve of the next big data privacy regulation to impact global businesses. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is destined to become one of the most important regulatory changes of 2018.</em></p>
<p><em>Guest blogger Robert Bond talks about the GDPR below as part of our <a href="http://bit.ly/2018trendsandpredictions">2018 Trends &amp; Predictions</a> series. Take the first step in bolstering your data privacy. <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP742">Try a free demo of our ethics and compliance education</a> on data privacy and GDPR.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>There is no doubt that the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), set to take effect on May 25, 2018, will be one of the most significant trends of the year. This regulation will have a major impact on companies, customers, individuals, and third party vendors around the world and, as interest in GDPR continues to climb, so too will preparation for GDPR compliance. For compliance teams around the world, this needs to lead to executive buy-in for resources, implementation support, and new employee training content.</p>
<p>GDPR is applicable to any business processing personal data in relation to EU citizens, wherever that business is in the world. Businesses will therefore need to analyse the “who, what, when, where and how” of their data processing activities over the next five months, if they haven't already started. Because GDPR imposes strict record keeping obligations in relation to different personal data processing activities, and failure to have adequate internal record keeping is an offense, the significant increase in enforcement and fines under GDPR will drive data protection to become a major C-Suite issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e0750451-03fe-4c9c-b99a-ccbf99530786">Six lawful grounds</a> are set out as part of the GDPR for processing personal data, of which consent is one ground on which legal and compliance often tend to focus. While there is no doubt that consent is necessary in many cases, particularly where the data is sensitive, other lawful grounds such as contractual necessity and legitimate interests are something that the compliance team will need to focus on.</p>
<p>GDPR introduces key principles such as transparency and accountability, so businesses will need to ensure that their privacy notices and mechanisms for obtaining lawful grounds for processing are spelled out in plain language, and that there is an audit trail within the business of when and how permission was obtained for processing and sharing personal data.</p>
<p>For businesses that process large volumes of personal or sensitive data as a core activity, a mandatory Data Protection Officer role should be created that will oversee compliance functions in relation to GDPR. Even if a mandatory Data Protection Officer is not required, many large businesses may feel the need to ensure that there is a team dedicated to managing GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>As GDPR increases a range of personal data rights for individuals such as access, portability and erasure, the compliance team will need to ensure that there are appropriate policies and standard operating procedures in place to deal with the ramifications of those exercised choices.</p>
<p>Many businesses do not currently have policies that cover areas such as data portability, right of erasure, and right to object to profiling.</p>
<p>As part of the GDPR, obligations are placed on controllers to ensure they have suitable agreements in place with vendors to whom they outsource personal data processing activities. Failure to have the appropriate contracts and measures in place will become an offense. As so many businesses outsource to cloud providers and other software as a service (SaaS) organizations, it will be a major task for compliance to audit those contracts and ensure that they are GDPR compliant. Given the focus that GDPR places on records management and internal record keeping, the compliance team will also need to ensure that there are appropriate policies and procedures to cover compliance and demonstrate accountability. </p>
<h3><strong>OUR PREDICTION</strong></h3>
<p>While it's clear that the effects of GDPR will reach far and wide across all industries, we'll be keen to keep an eye on how this new regulation will influence Facebook, Twitter, and other global media companies that rely heavily on user data to customize experiences and deliver targeted advertising. There is no denying that GDPR will impact everyone but we believe the most significant impact, both in terms of potential financial repercussions and changes to their core business, will be to online media companies and social networks that use data-driven targeting for advertising and customization. </p>

<p>Did you know that there were at least 27 cases that commented on the PPSA or the PPSR in 2017? By comparison, there were around 23 such cases in 2016, and around 18 such cases in 2015. The numbers are on the rise largely for one reason - some of us still do not appreciate the PPSA's reach, and by not properly applying the PPSA, security interests are either not perfected or perfected out of time, making the security interest the subject of disputes and vulnerable to a priority contest.</p>
<p><strong>Another PMSI decision</strong></p>
<p>30 January 2018 marks the 6<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the PPSA. As we approach this date, let us take a look at another decision on purchase money security interests (PMSIs). This is 1 of at least 5 PPSA decisions that concern PMSIs in the last 12 months. What can we learn from it?<br /><br />
In November 2017, the South Australian Supreme Court handed down its decision on <em><a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/sa/SASC/2017/163.html?context=1;query=Allied%20Distribution%20Finance%20Pty%20Ltd%20v%20Samwise%20Holdings%20Pty%20Ltd;mask_path=" title="Allied Distribution Finance Pty Ltd v Samwise Holdings Pty Ltd [2017] SASC 163">Allied Distribution Finance Pty Ltd v Samwise Holdings Pty Ltd [2017] SASC 163</a></em>. For those of us who would like a PPS refresher, this judgement is good summer reading, as Justice Blue gave an overview of the PPSA and its major principles. These include the meaning of “personal property”, “security interest”, “PPS lease” and “PMSI”, He also covered key PPSA concepts such as attachment, perfection and priority. <br /><br />
What we have in <em>Allied Distribution v Samwise Holdings</em> is a priority contest between the 2 parties. In essence, the action was for a declaration that Allied Distribution's PMSI has priority over other security interests with respect to 40 motorcycles. In his judgement, Justice Blue made it clear that, in the PPSA, the reference to a grantor obtaining “possession” of goods that are inventory (in section 62(2) regarding PMSI priority) is a reference to the grantor obtaining possession of that very inventory as a grantor of the PMSI and not in some other capacity. As a result, Allied Distribution is entitled to a declaration that its security interest has priority over Samwise Holdings' security interest.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson</strong></p>
<p>Without deep diving into legal analysis, the key lesson here is a simple one - the PMSI provisions in the PPSA afford priority to security holders who provide to the grantor the means of acquiring the grantor's interest in the personal property over other security holders as it is equitable to do so, but a security holder must follow the rules in the PPSA to enjoy PMSI priority. In particular, the security interest must be registered on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) before the time the grantor obtains possession of the goods if they are inventory, and the security interest must be registered within 15 business days of the grantor obtaining possession of the goods if they are not inventory. We have shared some insights regarding this with you before, for example, see <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/news_and_resources/industry_news/asset_protection_for_the_equipment_lessor_%E2%80%93_title_is_not_king_/" title="here">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A practice tip</strong></p>
<p>On a practical note, it is very important to remember that you must tick the PMSI box when you first register your security interest on the PPSR as you cannot amend a registration later to indicate PMSI.<br /><br />

This year, "Larry's Letter" by Blackrock CEO Larry Fink is making headlines at the week-long event. In a guest blog post, Caterina Bulgarella explores the implications of Fink's call to action. </em></p>
<p>The KPIs we evoke to define business excellence in the 21st century are shifting. Seldom does one company top the lists of best places to work, most effective CEOs, most ethical, <em>and</em> fastest growing. Organizations in the past could afford one stand out metric, but today's evolving economic environment requires an uncompromising approach to excellence. The complex risk posture of culture deepens the consequences of a business afflicted with tunnel vision. </p>
<p>Corporate failures of the past ten years reveal both unawareness and erroneous calculus. The choice to separate culture from execution, and culture from risk management, proved costly for organizations like Volkswagen, Wells Fargo, Lehman, BP, and others. Though these companies were not inherently flawed, the size of their ambitions far exceeded real capabilities; the C-suite overlooked the social fabric of their organization and strategized in a vacuum, without properly factoring the role of discretionary behavior, systemic inertia, and stakeholder expectations. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter" title="Larry Fink's">Larry Fink's</a> January 2018 CEO call to action, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-at-davos-is-talking-about-larry-finks-letter-to-ceos-2018-1" title="informally referenced as ">informally referenced as "Larry's Letter"</a> at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, qualifies this new breed of risk both companies and CEOs face today. Asymmetries in resources and opportunities, paired with profound and constant change, cause a <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-no/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">"paradox of high returns and high anxiety."</a> Owing to this growing gap, not only is there widening misalignment across stakeholder groups, but the opportunity for productive synergies is rapidly diminishing. </p>
<p>What's most compelling about Fink's letter is not the argument about social responsibility, but the underlying economic rationale from which it stems. The risk of increasing diseconomies and decreasing growth is looming larger and larger. This is why companies need to redefine how they think about excellence. The BlackRock CEO's call to action entails tangible requirements, starting with fully integrating the very complexity of today's environment into strategy design. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Fink2.jpg" /></div><p><strong>Fink offers CEOs five very specific recommendations:</strong></p>
<ol><li>Companies should show how they are contributing to society.</li><li>They should have a clear and public strategy about long-term growth.</li><li>Not only should their strategy be reviewed by the board of directors, but the company should also demonstrate understanding of the societal impact the business will have.</li><li>They should seek and use the insights of various stakeholder groups.</li><li>Boards should help companies achieve a clear vision of the type of social contributions they can make.</li></ol>
<p>It was widely reported that Fink's letter <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-at-davos-is-talking-about-larry-finks-letter-to-ceos-2018-1" title="dominated conversations in Davos">dominated conversations in Davos</a>. Indeed, the change purported in the message is too profound for it to be received without resistance. Instead of proclaiming sudden allegiance to a socially responsible model, it is likely business will struggle with the idea of adjusting their aim and expanding accountabilities. Companies may need time to explore the limitations of their current approaches and completely understand the consequences of what they do. And senior leaders may hesitate to review their commitments and more deeply connect with their aspirations. </p>
<p>An honest and genuine transformative process will require some degree of tension, but eventually cause an organization to become fully aware of its own contradictions. This type of inward clarity paves the way to an honest vision of the shifts needed to embrace a new model of excellence. </p>
<p>A well thought out culture framework can assist senior leaders in apprising their business's priorities, assets and capacities, as well as loftier goals. Once these insights become available, strategizing no longer happens in a vacuum but expresses a new level of foresight. The opportunity for change and purpose mostly resides in existing discrepancies. </p>
<p>As noted by Fink, companies should be socially responsible (and ethical) because they have the assets and resources to play a significant role in society. The issue is not whether business can contribute in a larger way, or what costs it may experience if it does, but what contributions it should pursue. Organizations must include all stakeholder groups in their planning. They must stretch their time horizon into the medium and long term timespans. And they must develop full view of the hidden and intangible impacts of their business. It's not just about the next quarter, nor does it stop at shareholder returns. </p>
<p>Helping organizations figure out the gaps between their practices and aspirations in an essential part of crystallizing their purpose. Hidden is that space is the key to excellence. </p>

As an executive officer of the company, she leads Lilly's global ethics and compliance function and serves on the Executive Committee. </em></p>
<p><strong>Q1. How long have you been working in the ethics and compliance field? </strong></p>
<p>I have been at Lilly for almost 24 years and in my current ethics and compliance role for just over five years. </p>
<p><strong>Q2. What did you want to be when you were growing up? </strong></p>
<p>I went to college thinking I wanted to be a veterinarian, which meant I needed to major in agriculture or chemistry. I chose chemistry. Five pages into a chemical equation at 3 A.M. one day, I decided that while I was good at chemistry, it simply didn't appeal to me. I changed my focus to political science and pre-law, and the rest is history. </p>
<p><strong>Q3. What are some of the most rewarding and challenging parts of your job? </strong></p>
<p>The most rewarding part of any job I've had is the people piece, and that is true in my current position. I am most proud of the success we have seen from our "people strategy" of bringing business leaders into ethics and compliance for developmental assignments and returning them to business leadership roles. It's a win-win-win:</p>
<ul><li>Our function benefits from the best and brightest minds, which keeps our program fresh and relevant. </li><li>Our high-potential talent benefits from a rich developmental experience. </li><li>Our program benefits from having ethics and compliance "ambassadors" with a renewed commitment to achieving high performance with high integrity in key leadership roles across the company. </li></ul>
<p>This approach has become a critical part of our ethics and compliance program. I also find it rewarding to be a champion of integrity. Trust is absolutely critical to Lilly's mission of helping people live longer, healthier, more active lives.</p>
<p>We ask people to take our medicines at some of the most vulnerable times in their lives; therefore, everything we say and do, and every decision we make, must be made with integrity. So, the work we do to help foster a culture of integrity throughout the company is key to our mission - and that is particularly rewarding. </p>
<p>One of the challenges we face is how to leverage data analytics to make us smarter, more effective, and more efficient. As a global company, we have a rich data set that documents our business activities; however, given our matrix organization and geographic spread, accessing and assembling the right data is no easy feat. Likewise, finding the most informative data cuts and correlations to help direct our work in ethics and compliance takes a combination of both art and science. We are working hard in this space, but we are just beginning our journey. </p>
<p><strong>Q4. What are three important traits a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer should possess? </strong></p>
<p>The 3 P's - passion, people, perseverance. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Passion</strong> for the work </li><li>The ability to connect with <strong>people</strong> to influence, network, and establish strong relationships </li><li><strong>Perseverance</strong> and a willingness to keep pursuing goals no matter the obstacles </li></ul>
<p><strong>Q5. If someone wanted to get more involved in promoting ethical behavior in their organization today, what could they do? </strong></p>
<p>At Lilly, we encourage all of our employees and leaders to be open and transparent with one another and to speak up if they have a question, concern, or idea. We also focus on being inclusive of diverse opinions and points of view. One way to start promoting ethical behavior in an organization is simply to begin having these conversations and sharing our stories so others can learn and grow. </p>
<p><strong>Q6. What advice would you give to recent college graduates and other professionals who may want to pursue a career in ethics and compliance? </strong></p>
<p>To be truly effective as an ethics and compliance professional, you need to know the business. </p>
<ul><li>What are the most important risks for your business? </li><li>What challenges, both internal and external, is your organization facing? </li><li>What external requirements must you meet?</li><li>What kind of culture does your organization have? </li></ul>
<p>To get this background, pursue opportunities that can help you gain this deep knowledge and understanding of the business you are supporting.</p>
<p>The 3 P's are also critical: have passion for the work, be able to influence people at all levels of the organization, and persevere relentlessly to meet your goals. </p>
<p><strong>BONUS Q. What is a book, movie, play, or song that had an impact on you? </strong></p>
<p>I am moved by Sheryl Sandberg's books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Women-Work-Will-Lead/dp/0385349947" title="Lean In">Lean In</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Option-Adversity-Building-Resilience-Finding/dp/1524732680" title="Option B">Option B</a>. Both books are great examples of the power of a personal story. Sandberg uses some of the darkest, most personal experiences in her life, and graciously shares how she managed and persevered in an effort to share learning and make others better. Both books are excellent leadership development resources. </p>

How long have you been working in the ethics and compliance field? </strong></p>
<p>When I really think about it, always. As a lawyer, clients would come to me for advice, and while the law tells us what we can't do, I always asked my clients to consider the ethical considerations of their decisions. In 2004, it seemed a natural transition from legal counsel to ethics and compliance. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Q2. What did you want to be growing up? </strong></p>
<p>I have always wanted to help people, so at first I wanted to be a psychiatrist, but then I learned that I would have to go to medical school. Then I wanted to be a lawyer.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Q3. What are some of the most rewarding and challenging parts of your job? </strong></p>
<p>The most rewarding is helping people come to a solution that meets the needs of everyone involved. The most challenging is when there is no answer that satisfies everyone and someone will not be able to proceed in the way that they want. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Q4. What are three important traits a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer should possess? </strong></p>
<p>Mental agility, independence, and empathy. I think that it's important for Chief Ethics and Compliance Officers to be able to think through ethical issues in new ways and consider all of the possibilities. Independence is key because your opinions and decisions must be as objective as possible, even when it might mean that you could suffer or have to take additional steps because of them. If you believe, like I do, that most people want to do the right thing and are truly trying to do the best job possible, you must have empathy. It's important so that you can understand their point of view and where they are coming from. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Q5. If someone wanted to get more involved in promoting ethical behavior in their organization, what could they do? </strong></p>
<p>In Scott Killingsworth's article <em><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2161076" title="Modeling the Message">Modeling the Message</a></em>, he talks about salience; when something is prominent, important, and noticeable. His point is that the way to promote ethical behavior is to make it top of mind so that it is a lens that everyone looks through. To do this, you have to talk about it. </p>
<p>We need to talk about the ethical implications of our actions in our staff meetings and with each other. When we decide not to charge an expense to the company, or recuse ourselves from a decision, or not participate in an activity, we need to tell people why and lead by example. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Q6. What advice would you give to recent college graduates and other professionals who may want to pursue a career in ethics and compliance? </strong></p>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of being a guest lecturer at the University of Illinois College of Law and I passed along this quote from Thomas Jefferson: "In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock." </p>
<p>This speaks to the trait of having mental agility, but I think that it's really important to know when you can be flexible and when you shouldn't be. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Q7. What is the best advice that someone has ever given you? </strong></p>
<p>Indra Nooyra, the CEO of Pepsi, <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html" title="answered this question in Fortune magazine">answered this question in Fortune magazine</a> this way. She said that her father taught her to always assume positive intent. It struck me when I read it and I remember it to this day. It's important for Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officers, and for all of us, to really try to understand where other people are coming from. As humans we all sometimes like to think the worst rather than giving others the benefit of the doubt. You will learn more, understand more, and gain more by being open to others. </p>

The processing of such information should be designed to serve mankind, the EU says in its <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR). GDPR, which is scheduled to take effect May 25, ushers in the biggest shakeup of privacy rules in decades.</p>
<p>There's truth to the EU's argument and one that companies must consider as they prepare for the deadline. There's a human element here, and the companies that are quick to grasp the magnitude of technology's impact on fundamental rights will be best prepared to capitalize on the growing need for robust safeguards.</p>
<p>Consider that globally about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day, including roughly <a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2017-2021-Executive-Summary.pdf">269 billion daily emails</a> and 15 million texts every minute. Americans alone use about 2.6 million gigabytes of <a href="https://web-assets.domo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17_domo_data-never-sleeps-5-01.png">internet data</a> per minute. The digital universe is huge, according to market intelligence provider IDC which estimates that the amount of data created and copied annually will explode to <a href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/data-age-2025-infographic-2017.pdf">163 zettabytes</a> by 2025 from just 16 zettabytes in 2016. That's the equivalent of watching the entire Netflix catalog 489 million times.</p>
<p>Also, consider that the digital technology explosion over the last 20 years has turned everyone into walking data points, and made data personalization crucial to business product development and the consumer experience. By 2025, according to IDC, people will interact with connected devices almost 4,800 times per day, up from just 218 in 2015. Therefore, our personal data has become that much more valuable, and more vulnerable.</p>
<p>And while we live and breathe data, most people are only vaguely aware that companies are gathering information and even less informed on what's being captured. Still, we share everything from ultrasound photos to our daily diets on Instagram.</p>
<p>Take the case of popular fitness app, Strava, which was recently caught in a firestorm of negative publicity when it was reported the company inadvertently <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/2/1/16945120/strava-data-tracking-privacy-military-bases">revealed sensitive</a> information about military personnel on active service. The app's data visualization map allows people to record their exercises and share with others and showed more than 3 trillion GPS data points, including the location and staffing of U.S. military bases worldwide.</p>
<p>Personal data gets personal. Canadian sex-toy maker, We-Vibe last year <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/10/sex-toy-maker-settlement-smart-vibrator-lawsuit/">agreed to pay</a> $3.7 million to resolve privacy claims regarding its “smart” vibrator that harvested data on how customers used the devices. Information was captured through smartphone apps that collected data such as temperature, intensity settings and frequency of use.</p>
<p>The first step for companies is to understand what's considered personal data and where it's stored. Article 4 of GDPR defines personal data as any information that can directly or indirectly identify a natural person. The deceased doesn't count and neither do companies, which under GDPR aren't recognized as people.</p>
<p>General personal data includes information we typically think about that's specific to the physical, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of a person and less obvious identifiers such as web cookies and IP addresses. GDPR also carves out for special treatment another level of personal information relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership and health or sex life.</p>
<p>The regulation lays out strict requirements on data management, handling, storage and security. Companies must inform people on how their data will be processed and give them the opportunity to grant or withdraw consent. Companies must also limit the use of the information collected to specific purposes, ensure its accuracy and develop a plan to secure and protect personal data going forward.</p>
<p>While GDPR governs the processing of personal information belonging to EU citizens, companies could use the law to adopt responsible data practices regardless of their customers' nationality or location. It also presents an opportunity for companies to take stock of data assets and identify what's important.</p>
<p>With less than four months to the start of GDPR, the debate about personal information is at an all-time high. However, if we agree that data protection is a fundamental human right, rather than be fearful of GDPR, companies should view the regulation as a call to action. It's a reminder that businesses have a responsibility to secure their customers' privacy not only because failing to do so would subject them to hefty fines, but also because a responsible company is a trustworthy one. And, trust is fast becoming a new competitive advantage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What are the GDPR implications to my business?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are several - but to name a few:  </p>
<ul><li><strong>The EU GDPR has sharp teeth:</strong> Under the GDPR, the fines imposed can be 20 million Euro, or up to four percent of a company's global annual turnover, whichever is greater.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>It affects companies worldwide:</strong> As mentioned above, it's not simply where the customer or prospect lives. Companies affected include controllers and processors established in the EU/EEA and companies not established in the EU/EEA, if they offer goods or services within the EU/EEA, irrespective of whether a payment by the data subject is required. The regulation has very broad reach, applying to virtually any company doing business in the EU.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>A data protection officer is required in some cases:</strong> Companies with over 250 staff must employ a data protection officer. The European community wants to ensure that large organizations processing a lot of data have someone who takes responsibility for that information, and having a data protection officer role is part of the new law.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Organizations must report on breaches</strong>: The GDPR will require companies to notify data protection authorities, such as the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), of any data loss incidents as soon as possible, which the EC suggests should be within 24 hours “when feasible”.  </li></ul>

If your organisation is one of the many affected by the changes, here are key steps to ensure your organisation is ready for the changes.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/116053_Mandatory_data_breach_banners_Blog_640x340_02%20(1).png?n=2821" /></div><p><strong>Step 1: Who is impacted? <br /></strong><br />
Do you have a clear understanding of who is impacted and the requirements of the scheme? Does your organisation have a clear understanding of how and why personal data is collected and stored across your organisation? Can you answer the following questions?<br /><br />
• Is it necessary to collect and store the information?<br />
• Where is information stored?<br />
• Are privacy protections built into your handling of the information?<br />
• What are the risks associated with holding the information?<br />
• Are there steps in place to destroy data when it's no longer needed?<br /><br /><strong>Step 2: Encourage collaboration</strong><br /><br />
Technology is firmly embedded in the way we work and do business, filtering through all levels and administrative sections of an organisation. Consequently, dealing with technology and data - and the risks these bring - requires an organisation-wide approach. Bringing IT, legal and other business units together ensures a deeper understanding of the issues, and a more considered approach.<br /><br /><strong>Step 3: Risk and Assurance </strong><br /><br />
Is the process for risk identification and assessment clear, with roles and responsibilities defined? Can you answer the following questions? What steps do you currently have in place to avoid data breaches? Do you have steps to ensure the physical security of computers and hard copy data? How does your organisation approach cybersecurity? You will also need to consider your extended value chain, which includes customers and suppliers. <br /><br /><strong>Step 4: Prepare for the worst</strong><br /><br />
Data breaches are an unfortunate reality in the digital age. In addition to <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/news_and_resources/industry_news/7_things_you_need_to_know_about_australia_s_mandatory_data_breach_reporting_scheme/" title="knowing when you need to report a data breach under the new scheme">knowing when you need to report a data breach under the new scheme</a>, your organisation should have a comprehensive incident response plan in place. A quick and effective response to a data breach can minimise the damage done, protect your reputation and even help you avoid the notification requirements. <br /><br />
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner suggests an incident response plan to include:<br /><br />
• the actions to be taken if a breach is suspected, discovered or reported by a staff member<br />
• the members of your data breach response team<br />
• the actions the response team is expected to take.<br /><br /><strong>Step 5: Build a compliant and secure workplace culture</strong><br /><br />
Once you have the plans, policies and response plans in place, getting your people on board is a crucial next step in making these things effective. Ongoing education and training programmes, targeted to all areas and levels of an organisation, about the changes and the organisations commitment to data security is a must.<br /><br />
Technology and data offer substantial business benefits but also carry inherent risks. Ensure you make the most of the benefits and minimise risk by taking a thorough approach to preparing for Australia's mandatory data breach reporting scheme.</p>

The initiative generates funding as a property is sold, continuing to do so with each subsequent sale, as long as the permissive caveat stays on the title.</p><p><strong>What is Homes for Homes?</strong></p>
<p>Homes for Homes is an initiative of The Big Issue, a not-for-profit social enterprise that has been operating for 21 years.</p>
<p>Homes for Homes aim to tackle Australia's chronic shortage of affordable housing by creating a new, sustainable funding stream. The initiative generates funding as a property is sold, continuing to do so with each subsequent sale, as long as the permissive caveat stays on the title. It neatly integrates into existing property settlement processes by using a permissive caveat as an instrument. It will operate on a national level as all states perform property transactions and are familiar with caveats. Currently, Homes for Homes has the permissive caveat in place in ACT, and properties in various other states have made commitments to lodge a Homes for Homes permissive caveat.</p>
<p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
<ol><li>The Homes for Homes permissive caveat is put on a property. This is done voluntarily by homeowners, developers and builders.</li><li>The vendor discloses the permissive caveat to the purchaser through a special condition on the Contract of Sale.</li><li> When this property is sold, the vendor donates 0.1 per cent of the property's sale price to Homes for Homes.</li><li>At settlement, the permissive caveat stays registered on the property, and Homes for Homes provides an original Caveator's Consent allowing for other dealings to be registered as priority on the property.</li><li>Once the purchaser has been registered as a proprietor, they can contact Homes for Homes to remove the caveat. This does not incur any cost to the purchaser as the ACTLIS (LTO) have agreed to waive the withdrawal of caveat fees for any Homes for Homes caveats.</li><li>If the new registered proprietor has chosen to leave the permissive caveat on title, when they decide to sell their home. they will then also make a tax-deductible donation of 0.1 per cent of the property's new sale price.</li><li>The permissive caveat is passed on from owner to owner, generating long-term funding within the state of which the property is located.</li><li>Housing providers apply for the funding to build more social and affordable dwellings. Money raised in the state, stays in the state.</li></ol>
<p><strong>How is the Homes for Homes permissive caveat different to other caveats?</strong></p>
<p>This permissive caveat to Homes for Homes will appear like a normal caveat on the title search. The differences to this caveat are:</p>
<ul><li>In most cases no Withdrawal of Caveat form will be collected at settlement, as the idea is to keep this permissive caveat on title to keep producing funding with each sale.</li><li>An original Caveator's Consent will be required to be provided at settlement by Homes for Homes, which is lodged together with the title, allowing registration of other dealings to take priority.</li><li>This caveat is not a barrier to incoming mortgagees as it does not prevent lodgement of new dealings and is only a signal that the registered proprietor has agreed to donate to a good cause.</li><li>In the case where the purchaser wants to remove the permissive caveat, there is <strong>no Withdrawal of Caveat fee</strong> involved for this caveat as the LTO in ACT has agreed to waive it.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Support for Homes for Homes</strong></p>
<p>Capital Airport Group is developing a new suburb in the ACT, Denman Prospect. They have committed to donate 0.1 per cent of the sale price for each block they sell in this suburb. Furthermore, they are putting the Homes for Homes permissive caveat on every contract, making Denman Prospect the first suburb in Australia to fully commit to the cause. This gives a large boost to the number of properties with the caveat.  Homes for Homes anticipate that the permissive caveats will stay on the titles in the future, allowing for more funding to help solve this important issue.</p>
<p>So far there have been approximately 300 dwelling sites sold in Denman Prospect, with another 2,000 planned for staged releases.</p>
<p>The federal government has also shown great support to this cause by investing $6 million towards the Homes for Homes initiative in June 2017.</p>
<p>Based on conservative estimates, Homes for Homes is projected to raise over $1.8 billion in the next 30 years.</p>

<hr />
<p><br />
Can a hashtag replace a hotline? If you've never considered that question before, one look at the #MeToo movement and recent sexual misconduct scandals should demonstrate that it's time to start, because in 2017, the traditional approach of speaking up and reporting misconduct has changed and social networks might be at the root. <br /><br />
The traditional approach of reporting through hotlines, HR, and legal often yields mixed results based on the corporate culture of an organization. The consequences of speaking up through these internal channels, including potential retaliation, reputational damage, or being flat-out ignored, can be scary enough to keep people quiet all together. In cultures where high levels of trust and transparency are encouraged and demonstrated from the top down, people may feel more comfortable speaking up and going through this process. Yet, this year demonstrates that when that culture is not fostered, employees may take matters in their own hands in ways that can destroy reputations and brands. <br /><br />
The new approach to reporting incidents, most recently through social media channels and news outlets, is likely frowned upon by those in ethics and compliance roles as it skips internal procedures and ignores the organizational policies. The ability to silence or sweep matters under the rug is almost impossible; everyone, regardless of rank or role, now has a megaphone with unlimited volume in the palm of their hand. <br /><br />
For companies, this trend may seem microscopic in the grand scheme of incident reporting volume. But, it does signal the growing need to find new ways to facilitate incident reporting. And, most importantly, reinforces the importance of creating a culture where employees can trust that their concerns will be taken seriously and addressed promptly. When people feel isolated or alienated by the processes put in place within their organization they find ways to band together through new platforms, created in real-time, outside of their organization.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what this looks like in reality and how effective it can be as an alternative to traditional internal reporting processes. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Weinstein%20Effect.JPG" /></div><p>In October 2017, Harvey Weinstein, co-founder of the Hollywood powerhouse Weinstein Company, was exposed by the New York Times for his long history of assault, harassment, and egregious misconduct. The story, and subsequent response, led to a resurgence of the long-dormant <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/09/world/metoo-hashtag-global-movement/index.html" title="#MeToo">#MeToo</a> movement on October 15th; it has served as a platform for men and women around the world to collectively speak-up on their own terms by rallying against the aggressors of sexual misconduct. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metoo-reaches-85-countries-with-1-7-million-tweets/" title="Within days">Within days</a>, #MeToo was the #1 trending topic globally on Twitter and had been applied to 1.7 million tweets across 85 countries with an additional 12 million references on Facebook. The image below demonstrates the sheer volume of conversations happening around the world using this hashtag. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/CNNViral.JPG?n=8733" /></div><p>The story on Weinstein and the #MeToo movement have led to increased media attention on reports of misconduct across industries, an escalated response from the organizations employing these professionals, and even self-reporting of misconduct by those who want to apologize and try to control how the stories of their illicit behavior reach the masses. <br /><br />
As a response to the wave of news surrounding high profile cases of misconduct and harassment, we've seen prominent publications such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/11/17/why-sexual-harassment-training-doesnt-stop-harassment/?utm_term=.e8b3d75fab27" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/upshot/sexual-harassment-workplace-prevention-effective.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20171121-why-sexual-harassment-training-doesnt-work" title="BBC">BBC</a> write articles with headlines including <em>Why Sexual Harassment Training Doesn't Stop Harassment</em> and <em>Sexual Harassment Training Doesn't Work</em>. <em>But Some Things Do.</em> In December 2017, TIME Magazine named “<a href="http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/" title="The Silence Breakers">The Silence Breakers</a>” as their Person of the Year, giving their highest honor and most prominent story to those who spoke up and reported misconduct. <br /><br />
Social media will never replace hotlines as an organizationally approved method for internally reporting misconduct, compliance failures, or unethical behavior but, the lesson learned globally is that if corporate culture ignores individual's reports, there is quantifiable proof that leveraging social media drives results and delivers change through disruption. </p>
<h3><u><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP705" title="Our Prediction">Our Prediction</a></u></h3>
<p>In 2018 and beyond, employees will feel more empowered to speak up and blow the whistle on unethical behavior, as they count on support from the global community, the media and the collective voice of millions to protect them from retaliation. The increased dialogue around harassment outside of the office will force organizations to look beyond training programs focused on these topics to a more comprehensive and culture-centric approach to changing the behavior at the root - within the individual. Those in leadership positions will be faced with even more pressure to set the tone and example for the rest of their organization and move beyond the mission/vision mantra statements by taking an active role in building a culture of respect for the individual. <br /><br /><em>Related SAI Global content: <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/an_open_letter_on_sexual_misconduct_in_the_workplace/" title="An Open Letter on Sexual Misconduct in the Workplace">An Open Letter on Sexual Misconduct in the Workplace</a></em></p>
<h3>Reflecting on our 2017 Predictions</h3>
<p>In January 2017, we predicted that employees would become more empowered in speaking up and blowing the whistle in the face of unethical behavior. We also predicted that shifting demographics would emphasize the importance of corporate culture and values, and that this year we would see “ethics and compliance news” featured in the mainstream. Considering the recent coverage of sexual misconduct, and the criticisms of the ineffectiveness of training focused on this behavior; one thing is certain, conversations regarding ethics and compliance today are more front-and-center than ever before.  </p>

In 2018, ethics and compliance training is poised to reach a new level of personalization that is specific to each individual. Learn more about this trend below and read about the proactive and reactive evolution facing our industry by downloading '<a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP705" title="The Future of Ethics, Compliance, Risk, and Corporate Culture: 8 Trends and Predictions for 2018">The Future of Ethics, Compliance, Risk, and Corporate Culture: 8 Trends and Predictions for 2018</a>.' </em></p>
<p>Ethics and compliance training is experiencing continuous improvement in the relevance and targeting of content for specific employees. The ability to deliver the right content to the right people at the right time has been achieved and is even now being implemented. <br /><br />
Today, employees are routinely exposed to learning experiences that are specific to their role, responsibility, and risk level. That improved relevance and tailored approach is leading to more engagement, higher levels of employee satisfaction and, ultimately, a more effective program. Elements of modern adaptive learning programs such as profiling, action mazes, and test-out are becoming the standard versus the exception. <br /><br />
In a case study we recently completed with <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/case_studies/2017/johnson_controls_international_builds_award_winning_ethics_compliance_program/" title="Johnson Controls International">Johnson Controls International</a>, their Director of Global Compliance Programs was able to demonstrate a clear year-over-year increase in knowledge retention across all nine risk areas in their ethics and compliance program thanks to test-out functionality and the adaptive learning experience they've slowly been building towards over the past few years. The ability to test-out and measure the effect of that capability simply wasn't as readily available, or easy to implement and automate, as it is now. In 2017 the technology that supports ethics and compliance training caught up to the technology we use in our lives outside of work. <br /><br />
In 2018, we predict that ethics and compliance will make a significant leap in user experience (UX) and the user interface (UI) of these programs. Training will continue to evolve and become a more personalized experience, both in terms of the content that employees receive and how they consume that content. <br /><br />
Unique employee preferences based on role, experience, resonance and interests will drive training and learning programs with elements from mainstream technology like curation and “playlists”, similar to what we see in Netflix, Spotify and Apple Music, adapted to business use. This “consumerized” approach will allow employees to pick and choose content and, ultimately will help companies drive adoption and retention.<br /><br />
These new elements of ethics and compliance training, combined with a campaign-based approach that spreads training out into short, recurring experiences throughout the year will provide greater insights into employee behavior and change the overall perception of “training” over the course of the year. By using technology to reduce the amount of time spent on training, we also expect new opportunities for face-to-face workshops and manager-driven conversations around ethical behavior, values, risk, and compliance. We're also paying close attention to the role of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, serialized content, and mobile gaming in E&amp;C programs. While we don't envision that these innovations will become an industry standard in 2018, we do expect to see some experimentation in each of these four areas. </p>
<p><strong>Reflecting on our 2017 predictions</strong></p>
<p>In January 2017, we made four predictions around advancements and innovations in ethics and compliance. We predicted that: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">1. mobile technology would give compliance training a facelift;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">2. compliance would become a campaign (not a circumstance);</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">3. this campaign-based approach to education would take less time but make a bigger impact;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">4. this education would shift from a “just in case” perspective to take a more “just in time” approach.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Within our products and solutions at SAI Global, these four predictions all came true. Mobile technology did give compliance training a facelift, as every new piece of content we developed over the last twelve months was designed and built to work on any mobile device and use common “scroll” and “swipe” behavior as part of the experience. We continued to help our customers shift to a campaign-based approach to their program, cutting down on seat time for employees. In the case of Johnson Controls, that reconfiguration reduced seat time to 90 minutes per year (versus 6-10 hours). Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with 80% of surveyed employees responding that they would apply what they learned to their job. </p>
<p>Lastly, the perception around compliance training has changed across the industry, with most acknowledging that taking training once a year on a risk area, just in case you face that risk in the future, will not always be helpful when in the moment when employees are faced with that risk. In the future, we anticipate contextual, push-notification-driven mobile learning experiences to make “just-in-time” training a reality.  <br /><br /></p>

We look at the key insights and the webinar poll question results.</p><p><strong>PPS tip: consider registering your security interest when you have reasonable grounds to believe you would become a secured creditor</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Personal Property Securities Act 2009</em> (Cth) (<strong>PPS Act</strong>) turned 6 on 30 January 2018. In last week's <a href="http://ps3.saiglobal.com/practical-pps-2018-webinar">'Practical PPS for 2018' webinar</a>, we looked at a recent judgement, <em>P Twin Holdings Pty Limited as Trustee for the P Twin Trust v SG Old Pty Limited</em> [2017] WADC 77 (available <a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/wa/WADC/2017/77.html">here</a> at AustLII), where a lawyer was found negligent to a client for failing to register a security interest in the manner prescribed by the PPS Act. We looked at the lessons learnt, so they are not lessons lost.</p>
<p>One of the key lessons from this judgement is that the registration of a financing statement on the PPS Register is not conditioned upon the execution of any documents, such as a loan agreement or a general security deed. Almost 80% of the webinar attendees were unaware that you could register a financing statement before any formal agreement to create the security interest is executed. This is a good example of how many of us may not be aware of how some parts of the PPS Act operate, and there is a risk that our security interests are either not perfected or perfected out of time, making the security interests the subject of disputes.</p>
<p><strong>Fact - formal agreement is not a prerequisite to perfection by registration</strong></p>
<p>Under the PPS Act, it is possible to register a security interest before any formal agreement to create that security interest is executed. All that is required for registration is that the person undertaking the registration forms the belief, on reasonable grounds, that the security interest will be created. This important protection for secured parties can be found in <a href="http://www7.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ppsa2009356/s151.html">section 151</a> of the PPS Act.</p>
<p>While registration is not mandatory under the PPS Act, it has obvious advantages. Registration is the most common way to achieve perfection, which brings with it two main benefits to the secured party. First of all, it defines the priority status the security interest has relative to other security interests in the same collateral. Second and importantly, it helps ensure the security interest survives the bankruptcy or insolvency of the grantor.</p>
<p>While on the topic of PPS registrations, the Australian Financial Security Authority (<strong>AFMA</strong>) publishes quarterly statistics on the operation of the PPS Register. The statistics for the December quarter in 2017 have just been released, and you can read AFMA's commentary <a href="https://www.afsa.gov.au/statistics/ppsr-quarterly-statistics">here</a>.</p>









  


<p><strong>When to register - when you have reasonable grounds</strong></p>
<p>It would be prudent for an entity to consider registering a financing statement when it has reasonable grounds to believe it would become a secured party to the collateral, even if documents are yet to be prepared or yet to be signed.

<p>I'm a lawyer by training and have been practicing law since 2000. I spent the first five years of my career working at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, focused primarily on the regulation of nuclear power facilities. After that opportunity, I spent the next five years at two different utilities companies, before eventually joining General Electric's nuclear energy business as their Chief Compliance Officer. While there, I focused on regulatory compliance, third party risk management, organizational culture, and other aspects of the compliance program. I worked there for five years before being offered the role I have now as the first Chief Compliance Officer at PSEG, a diversified energy company based in Newark, NJ that's been in business since 1903. My focus today is on modernizing and growing our compliance program. </p>
<p><strong>Q2: What did you want to be when you were growing up? </strong></p>
<p>From a young age, I always knew I wanted to be a lawyer. There are many lawyers in my family, including my uncle, who taught me that being a lawyer is an admirable career focused on serving others who need help. Early on in my legal career, I was focused on international legal work. Now, in my time in compliance, the most appealing and impactful aspect is the focus on building an ethical culture. </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>With such a strong focus on tone at the top and tone from the middle, it's important to remember that compliance officers need to be leaders and set the tone for everyone else.</p><p>Antonio Fernández</p><p>Chief Compliance Officer, PSEG</p></blockquote><p><strong>Q3: What are some of the most rewarding and challenging parts of your job? </strong></p>
<p>The most rewarding part of being a Chief Compliance Officer is seeing your hard work pay off and the fruits of your labor manifest themselves in different, unexpected ways. When I started this role, I was the first person to ever be PSEG's CCO, so I was creating a program somewhat from scratch. Building a team, hiring into new roles, promoting people, changing the code of conduct, and having a front row seat to see how all of those things actually impact our people is very rewarding. </p>
<p>For example, last year we spent a significant amount of time conducting in-person training for every leader in the company - managers, supervisors, etc. Thousands of people. That training was focused on what they should do when someone comes forward and says “I have a question. I have a concern. Something is bothering me.” Over the holidays, I spent time with my family in Puerto Rico and visited the PSEG crews helping with the relief and recovery efforts. Two of the supervisors in our crew had attended my training sessions and approached me to thank me for the training in person. Having people you don't really know share their positive compliance experiences is really special. </p>
<p>As a compliance officer, my biggest challenge is prioritizing my time and resources and exercising good judgement when you have competing interests and priorities. You're never going to get to everything on your list, and sometimes certain projects have to wait, so the hardest decision can often be 'what deserves my attention, and my team's attention, right now?' You are always managing that balancing act, because like any other organization, you have to operate with the resources that are available to you. It makes you more thoughtful in your approach to the job because it requires you to really think about what's most important in that moment.</p>
<p><strong>Q4. What are three important traits a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer should possess? </strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Intellectual curiosity</strong>: The compliance field is very broad and changing constantly, so it's difficult to be a CCO and know everything. The ability to quickly absorb and learn new information about your business and become a subject matter expert across a number of topics is very important. You have to be a 'learn it all', not a 'know it all.'</li><li><strong>People skills</strong>: The CCO needs to be really good on the soft skills. There is a common misconception by many employees that compliance is a barrier to be overcome, so being able to influence others and work well with people across departments is very important. It allows you to be perceived by your peers, senior leadership, and board as someone that has an important role to play and has value to add and plays a large role in building an effective program. </li><li><strong>Leadership</strong>: With such a strong focus on tone at the top and tone from the middle, it's important to remember that compliance officers need to be leaders and set the tone for everyone else. You need to be perceived and recognized as a leader who can move and inspire people. The core functions of our job require us to work with other people on a daily basis, so those leadership skills are critical in helping to persuade people to do things they may not always want to do. Compliance is a team sport.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Q5. If someone wanted to get more involved in promoting ethical behavior in their organization today, what could they do? </strong></p>
<p>In the utilities and industrial space, there is a very strong analog to safety. A lot of the effort to drive safety culture are efforts that pre-date compliance, culture, and integrity initiatives. The safety performance of companies, early on, had issues with fatalities and injuries, so there were clear and measurable indications of a poor safety culture - today, you don't see that anymore. What has changed is that everyone in the organization talks about safety and every leader makes it clear and behaves like that it's important to them.</p>
<p>From the most senior levels down to front line management, everyone decided that safety was important and that they would all do everything they could to keep people safe. Once they all aligned on that as a value, and a collective mission, it made executing on that idea much easier. My industry's focus on safety culture has really evolved to where we are honest about misses and use them to help improve things in the future. The same changes and approach can be applied to compliance and integrity. It's a great playbook to drive cultural change, but that change takes constant effort and takes time to make it happen. </p>
<p><strong>Q6. What advice would you give to recent college or university graduates and other professionals who may want to pursue a career in ethics and compliance? </strong></p>
<p>Be open to taking chances and measured, calculated risks, and never be too proud to do a certain job. If you're always open to learning something new, experiencing different things, and picking up new skills, then you're moving the ball forward, even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment. The path of your career isn't always linear and upwards - it goes sideways, backwards, forwards, and ultimately, with a little luck and perseverance, it ends up where you want to be. </p>

This was when the first intake of students for the University of Technology Sydney's (UTS) “Legal Futures and Technology” major commenced their studies. This course is the first undergraduate legal major in legal technologies and legal futures taught in Australia.[1] It is reported that UTS is following in the footsteps of overseas universities, such as Stanford University, that offer legal technology degrees.[2]</p>
<p>There is a good reason for universities to offer similar courses. The legal landscape today is very different from the one we knew just a few years ago. Today, clients <em>expect</em> their lawyers to leverage technology to provide advice in the most cost effective and time efficient ways. To meet this expectation, many lawyers have turned to legal technologies, including data visualisation. The concept of visualisation is not new. Did you know that Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, used what we would today recognise as a pie chart to illustrate the fate of hospitalised soldiers in 1858?[3] This led to improvements to hospital hygiene which continue to benefit us today.</p>
<p>In the legal world, visualisation enables lawyers to see the concepts in not only a more interesting but also a more useful manner. For example, one area where visualisation is having an enormous impact is in interpretation of commercial information in search results from the like of the ASIC registers, the National Personal Insolvency Index, and the Personal Property Securities Register. </p>
<p>Consider this example. Lawyers always need to quickly extract relevant content from many searches from these and other registers, then use that information to advise a client, prepare transaction documents or draft a legal opinion. When each search generates a few pages of linear information in the form of PDF reports, and each matter requires a few searches, the result is pages and pages of information. This information then needs to be sifted through to find details that are relevant. With the help of visualisation technology, lawyers can abandon archaic traditional practices and drive better engagement by presenting their advice (at least in part) in a visual format. Visualisation technology can help lawyers speed up the processes without compromising on the quality of their advice. </p>
<p>Now, let us take a look at this from the client's perspective. A good lawyer needs to know the law and apply the law to the client's matter. To be a <em>great</em> lawyer, it is important to also be a communicator. In a recent white paper by LexisNexis, leading practitioners discussed visualisation as an aid to clients understanding transaction structures, documents and parties' responsibilities. It is clear that “clients want to be given clear information”, and “many of them like graphics when these are well presented and fairly show the right information”.[4]  </p>
<p>What does this all mean? The correct application of legal technology such as visualisation translates to cost effectiveness and time efficiency, and this benefits the client (for example, by getting better and faster advice) as well as the law firm (for example, for meeting, or better still, exceeding, the client's expectations).  </p>
<p>A practical tip[5] for lawyers when sourcing such a technology solution - while a critical prerequisite here is rapid access to accurate information that is presented in an easy to understand format, do not forget that security of information is undeniably important. Law firms must safeguard information, including commercial information, whether that is presented visually or not. To satisfy their own and their clients' security demands, when law firms select a legal technology service provider, it is preferable to pick one who hosts the platform being used in Australia and the data not be replicated overseas without consent. The host should also meet strict privacy legislation obligations, including any disclosure of any personal information. If cloud based storage is used, it would be wise to know just how secure it is: that is, how the information is stored and how it is accessed, particularly where multiple parties are concerned.  </p>

According to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2017" title="2017 Global Gender Gap Report">2017 Global Gender Gap Report</a>, it'll take roughly 100 years to close the current divide. That is probably 100 years more than what women and society can afford. Today, women's voices aren't being heard enough, and that is true in the political arena as well as in the workplace. </p>
<p>The events of the past 12 months make the story of these opposite and complementary trends even more palpable. While a <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/12/175-ceos-join-forces-for-diversity-and-inclusion/" title="growing number of CEOs">growing number of CEOs</a> have joined forces to promote diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) in their organizations, companies continue to be caught red-handed, forced to explain <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber" title="discrimination">discrimination</a> and/or <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/355823379/Google-s-Ideological-Echo-Chamber#from_embed" title="discriminatory beliefs">discriminatory beliefs</a> in their work environments. And although the stories of Google and Uber foreshadowed the potential liabilities nested in many companies today, nobody could predict the avalanche of sexual harassment revelations that the Weinstein scandal, #MeToo, and #TimesUp movements unleashed. We thought  our biggest problem was the <a href="https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/" title="pay gap">pay gap</a> and the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2017/05/21/432758/womens-leadership-gap/" title="women's leadership gap">women's leadership gap</a> until we were forced to confront a much harder truth: Today, gender differences are not simply the source of unfair employee practices, they continue to be the driver of abusive behavior toward women in the workplace.</p>
<p>While words can inspire and uplift, we could use more sobriety in rhetoric, and significantly more focus when it comes to action. And that's where the opportunity for ethics and compliance practitioners exists today. There are synergies that could be created between D&amp;I and ethics and compliance (E&amp;C) practices that are missing at the moment. According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/global-diversity-and-inclusion-survey.html" title="recent survey">recent survey</a>, 87% of companies value D&amp;I, but close to 50% haven't been able to turn their commitments into adequate practices. D&amp;I is still viewed as a legal obligation by 1 in 5 companies, though the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2308689" title="human costs">human costs</a> of inequality alone should suffice to convince all of us that making strides in this area is simply the right thing to do and what any ethical company should aspire to achieve in the 21st century.</p>
<p>There are at least five reasons why E&amp;C officers should work more closely with their D&amp;I colleagues, looking for synergies and opportunities for joint action.  </p>
<p>1. It remains unclear what we actually mean when we say “Tone at the Top.” Rhetoric is unlikely to produce ethical leadership. Instead of asking senior leaders to deliver lofty speeches about the organization's commitment to ethics and its values, we could provide them, through D&amp;I, with a full platform to demonstrate the company's ethical orientation. Senior leaders could choose to be held accountable for promoting D&amp;I and linking it to the company's strategy. This alone could have a tangible impact on the organization's leadership pipeline and, at the same time, bring about increased transparency in a number of important D&amp;I metrics.</p>
<p>2. Nonconscious bias is one of the roadblocks we need to deal with if we want to expand the impact of diversity and create the necessary enablers for genuine inclusion. We know it makes a difference to help employees develop awareness of these biases; it is the first step to unlearn blind spots and start seeing people for who they are rather than through the lens of the stereotypes we hold. Importantly, non-conscious bias training can also facilitate a type of mental mastery and moral maturity that employees might need when it comes to ethical challenges. That is, investing in this type of training and other similar forms of training can enhance people's overall ability to respond to ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>3. One of the biggest E&amp;C challenges organizations face today has to do with creating a speak-up culture in which all employees feel comfortable sharing their concerns and reporting observed unethical conduct. From the standpoint of minority members in the organization, this challenge is twice as hard. Creating an inclusive culture means creating an environment in which everybody can contribute with their perspectives. Whatever is being done on the D&amp;I side to empower the voice of minority groups should be aligned with what is done on the E&amp;C side to increase employees' comfort with reporting unethical conduct. Speak-out metrics among minorities could also be used by E&amp;C practitioners as an indicator of the impact of their own efforts.</p>
<p>4. In a recent study about code of conduct best practices, SAI Global found that only 50% of companies use the code to put emphasis on D&amp;I. As the code of conduct has the potential to play a powerful role in shaping the organization's tone and conduct, this seems to be a missed opportunity. Going forward, code of conduct practices should address the current gap and provide a more definitive perspective on what organizations need to do to promote equality in the workplace.</p>
<p>5. Finally, the long-standing approach of using employee resource groups to further the state of D&amp;I in the workplace has shown that these resources can also expand the organization's <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0916/pages/are-employee-resource-groups-good-for-business.aspx" target="_blank">ability</a> to address specific business challenges. Given that today companies face increasing ethical risk, it would make sense to leverage these groups to address both D&amp;I and ethical issues. Employees that converge together as a result of specific affinities might provide unique insight into the organization's ethical risks in certain areas. E&amp;C leaders should make sure to leverage their insightful perspective. </p>

Our integrated risk management solutions are a combination of leading capabilities, services and advisory offerings that operate across the entire risk lifecycle allowing businesses to focus elsewhere.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"></p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/119463_Facebook_data_privacy_issue_Linkedin_blog_1200x644.png" /></div><p>It's all over the news: personal data on Facebook has been used without people's consent, for purposes where consent would likely not be given. The shock waves of this scandal shattered global perception about the handling of personal data and raised the visibility of personal data protection and the real impact of data misuse. Companies around the globe now understand their obligations to protect individual's data at the risk of brand reputation. And all of this is happening on the eve of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will come into effect in May. Not only will organizations need to satisfy regulators but perhaps even more importantly, protect their own brand reputation and business resilience. </p>
<p>Consider the impact on Facebook: Their $40bn in advertising revenue is expected to be impacted, shares will no longer be kept by many institutional investors, major brands like Tesla are breaking ties, regulators are coming after them with huge fines and individuals might bring law suits against Facebook and their partner Cambridge Analytics seeking justice for treating their personal data with disregard. On top of this Facebook's reputation and brand may be damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>The honeypot of using personal data for commercial or political goals has an enormous attraction. Every time we fill in personal data in apps to get rewarded we add to personal profiles being sold to others. If you are not paying, you are the product.</p>
<p>It's only recently that global audience and regulators are starting to understand the impact of being digitally 'owned' by companies and parties that have objectives we are not always aware off. It's this awareness that led to the new EU regulation.</p>
<p>GDPR defines the measures organizations have to take to protect the personal data they keep on their digital systems. It defines the obligation for 'user consent', permission to be granted to use the data and also the 'right to be forgotten'. Regulators across the globe are reviewing their regulations and it may be expected other geographies will tighten their laws as well.</p>
<h5>GDPR compliance</h5>
<p>In order to comply with GDPR organizations initially were focused on appointing a Data Privacy Officer (DPO) and reviewing contracts with their IT vendors. But now increasingly they are looking for policies and processes to be in place in order to comply with the regulation. A GDPR requirement is “the ability to ensure the ongoing Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and Resilience of processing systems and services.” and “a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.” In order to achieve this, a comprehensive cyber security framework needs to be implemented to embed the processes for GDPR compliance, including protection of (access to) information systems. </p>
<h5>Where are the risks?</h5>
<p>In essence, organizations need to sufficiently protect the personal data on their systems. Where are the risks that need to be managed and mitigated? In three buckets: employees, IT systems and IT vendors. Let's start with employees.</p>
<p>An alarming amount of data breaches are caused by current employees. Staff of all levels across a variety of departments either have access to or process personal data every day. But if employees are not aware of the GDPR and red flags to be aware of, a simple action like opening a phishing email, losing a USB stick, sharing a laptop or leaving a workstation unlocked could lead to a catastrophic data breach. </p>
<p>The second bucket of risk is within the organization's IT systems and IT Security technology.</p>
<p>The investments on securing IT systems are high but what if the vulnerability scanner isn't updated with the latest security patch in time? Or the firewall? Or the virus scanner? Do we trust our cyber security staff or do we need to validate timely updates and password changes on a continuous basis? Asking the question is giving the answer.</p>
<p>The third risk to focus on is with IT vendors. Increasingly we outsource to cloud vendors, which means the personal data we are responsible for sits on their systems. Who are these vendors? How solid are they from a financial perspective? Who are the beneficial owners? And also important: how do they manage their IT infrastructure towards cyber security resilience. Did they update their firewalls and scanners in a timely manner?</p>
<h5>How to stay out of trouble</h5>
<p>52% of cyber security issues globally are caused by human error. Implementing a robust training program with interactive, engaging reminders to embed the importance of data protection throughout the organization is the best way to protect the business and ensure ongoing consumer trust.</p>
<p>The IT systems and IT security systems should be verified on their cyber risk resilience. Not by asking the cyber security team questions around the effectiveness of the defined controls (did you install the patch in time, did you change the password regularly) but by connecting an IT Risk supervisory system to the IT systems and IT security systems and testing the controls in an automated way. This should be tested continuously and not by asking the cyber security team once every three months or prior to an audit, often the common practice. The result is reporting that can be used to identify defence weaknesses, or for audit purposes and to share with regulators and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The third bucket of risk is with the IT vendors that keep personal data on their systems. In the vendor on-boarding process questions are usually directed to the vendor about their cyber security resilience. A better way is to connect the IT Risk supervisory system to 'public' sources such as the World Check database and retrieve all relevant information of the vendor and its directors online. Based on the results of that online assessment, the IT Risk systems raise a red flag and kick off workflows that initiates appropriate action and response to the findings. </p>
<p>And a good way of measuring the IT vendors' cyber resilience is to not ask the vendor questions but to verify their Internet facing IT systems and check online and in real time if they installed the required patch in time or if there is a port open on their firewall. Continuously and automated, done by the IT Risk system. Based on how they score again the relevant workflows and reports are initiated to take appropriate action, taking into account the risk category the vendor is in.</p>
<p>If organizations take an integrated view on where the personal data risks are in their organization and take appropriate measures that really are effective, GDPR compliance will be within reach and brands can be protected. The other way of staying safe is to not connect any IT system or application to the outside world but in nowadays digital world that's difficult to imagine.<br /><br /></p>

Consumers, employees, and employers demand evidence of high ethical standards in the businesses they buy from and work for. Reputations that take years to build can be lost in minutes as a result of ethical failures and, once lost, <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/consumer_trust_index/">consumer and employee trust can be hard to rebuild</a>. It's vitally important to create the right ethical culture and to build an effective compliance infrastructure in organizations to manage and mitigate compliance risk.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in the area of bribery and corruption where, in addition to the reputational risks, laws are complex and far reaching; penalties for non-compliance are often breathtakingly severe.</p>
<h5>Show, Don't Tell</h5>
<p>The management of bribery risk related to gifts, hospitality and inducements is a cultural rather than a technical or procedural issue. The best way to manage this risk is to ensure that organizations have in place and currently practice an effective and sustained communication and awareness program that helps employees to recognize bribery risks, understand 'what good looks like,' and have the right values and attitudes to drive compliance in practice.</p>
<p><strong>And while this concept may be hard to argue, many organizations are still using <em>manual processes</em> to manage gifts, hospitality and inducements. This approach is high risk leading to inconsistencies and inefficiency and has been found wanting by regulators and professional bodies.</strong></p>
<p>However, driving a cultural shift is challenging, particularly when the policies concerned are detailed and not always intuitive. To be appropriate, proportionate, and effective, many policies around gifts and hospitality are necessarily complex. Unless an organization takes a 'zero tolerance' stance (often neither practical nor desirable), gifts and hospitality polices need to take account of a number of variables, only some of which are listed below:</p>
<ul><li>type and value of the gift or hospitality</li><li>roles of the parties involved</li><li>location in which they are given or received</li><li>currency</li><li>time of year</li><li>cumulative value of all gifts given to an individual or team over time</li></ul>
<p>In addition, some gifts or hospitality may be acceptable if approval from a manager is given while others can be offered or accepted on the spot. In short, it's a minefield for employees to understand and for resource-poor compliance departments to monitor and enforce. It's worth underscoring that many organizations attempt to track this using manual processes, often with tools not purpose-built for the task (for example, spreadsheets).</p>
<p>In the current business climate, demonstrable proof of integrity speaks loudest. Organizations are better suited to ditch the spreadsheets and manual tracking of gifts received, and instead move to a purpose-built software solution that helps organizations codify best practice, drive appropriate workplace behavior, and demonstrate compliance. Done correctly, this impacts culture and mitigates bribery risks. </p>
<h5>Bribery: The Gift That Keeps on Giving<br /><br /></h5>
<p>In recent years, we have seen significant penalties in terms of fines and deferred prosecution agreements. And it's not just the big fish like <a href="https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2017/01/17/sfo-completes-497-25m-deferred-prosecution-agreement-rolls-royce-plc/">Rolls Royce</a> and <a href="https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2017/04/10/sfo-agrees-deferred-prosecution-agreement-with-tesco/">Tesco</a>, who are in the line of sight for law enforcement - smaller organizations are routinely investigated and prosecuted. The 2015 case of <a href="http://thebriberyact.com/2015/06/18/significant-jail-term-in-edinburgh-construction-works-bribery-case/">Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Action Building Contracts Ltd.</a> resulted in hefty jail sentences meted out to directors and public officials.</p>
<p>Globally, prosecutors are coordinating their activities on an unprecedented level. Rolls Royce made payments totaling £671M / $948.8M USD to UK, US and Brazilian authorities while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikakelton/2016/02/19/vimpelcoms-landmark-bribery-settlement-by-the-numbers/#7a7badd07e07">Vimpelcom</a> paid one of the biggest penalties in the history of the FCPA to the DoJ, the SEC, and the Dutch authorities.</p>
<h5>Bribery Isn't Always Readily Apparent</h5>
<p>The inappropriate use of gifts, hospitality and inducements is a recurring feature of most of these cases. Whether it's the 'gift' of a Rolls Royce Silver Spirit or tickets to football matches, meals out and visits to lap dancing bars prior to awarding public sector contracts, this is clearly a key area of exposure to bribery risk for organizations and individuals alike.</p>
<p>Regulatory and professional bodies are responding with new, stronger, guidance and are highlighting inadequacies in current systems.</p>
<ul><li>MiFiD II includes stricter rules on inducements that are having a widespread impact on the financial services industry. The new regulation is informed, in part, by the FCA's 2015 <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/thematic-reviews/inducements-and-conflicts-interest-thematic-review-key-findings">thematic review of inducements</a> and conflicts of interest where inadequacies in hospitality logs were a key finding.</li><li>The National Audit Office's <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Investigation-into-the-acceptance-of-gifts-and-hospitality.pdf">investigation</a> into the acceptance of gifts and hospitality in central government found that rules and processes on gifts and hospitality could be more stringent.</li><li>Accounting and professional services organizations have not been immune to issues relating to gifts, hospitality and inducements (see, for example, recent reports involving <a href="http://observer.com/2017/11/mckinsey-hires-saudi-princelings-could-it-be-innocent-nepotism/">McKinsey</a> and <a href="https://www.irba.co.za/news-headlines/press-releases/update-on-irba-investigations-into-kpmg">KPMG</a>). The International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants has a <a href="https://www.ifac.org/system/files/publications/files/IESBA-Exposure-Draft-Proposed-Revisions-to-the-Code-Pertaining-to-the-Offering-and-Accepting-of-Inducements.pdf">project</a> underway to strengthen the provisions in the <em>Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants </em> regarding the accepting and offering of inducements</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h5>Show Me The Money?</h5>
<p>With an increase in oversight from regulatory and professional bodies (and for good reason), simple spreadsheets simply won't cut it to accurately and appropriately track gifts and hospitality engagements within your organization to any meaningful - or defensible - degree.</p>
<p>Creating easy and more innovative ways for all employees to comply with internal policies is key to embedding and sustaining a culture of compliance. And actions speak louder than words. Show, don't tell. Organizations need to demonstrate a strong compliance process. For gifts and hospitality, embedding the underlying rules in a software solution to enable automation of employee requests and approvals is the simplest way to ensure this compliance.</p>

In a Q&amp;A with Eric Morehead, a certified compliance and ethics professional with 18 years of compliance experience, we explore what the Department of Justice and other regulatory bodies expect from E&amp;C programs in 2018, how they define program effectiveness, and how to take a risk-based approach that helps meet those expectations. </em></p>
<p><strong>Beyond looking at completion rates, how can you measure and test the effectiveness of ethics and compliance training? <br /></strong><br />
I think you can look to other data metrics on timing of answers, the number of failures on particular questions, and the time spent on certain sections of the online training, as well as other data collected by the system you're using to deliver that training. You can also look at data related to demographics, location, and job function related to those responses. All of this data is helpful within a training tool to spot trends. Outside the training platform itself (or in conjunction with the platform), organizations can test through internal surveys after training (3 months or 6 months later, for example) to gauge longer-term understanding and retention. There's a great example of how employee surveys and "testing out" can work in a recent case study SAI Global completed <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/case_studies/2017/johnson_controls_international_builds_award_winning_ethics_compliance_program/" title="with Johnson Controls International">with Johnson Controls International</a>, where they were able to show, with data, that employees understood all nine of their risk topics more in 2017 than they did in 2016. </p>
<p><strong>Can you provide a few examples of what an informal communication plan looks like around an ethics and compliance program? </strong></p>
<p>A communication plan can be as simple as a quarterly message from compliance to managers encouraging them to include a few bullet points about a particular risk topic in their regular communication, or as sophisticated as a matrixed timeline of multiple ongoing communication efforts (live touchpoints, current events in the news, video, emails, newsletters, manager-led communications, “Compliance Week” activities, and quizzes/games/competitions).</p>
<p>These could come from a varied group of sources, including execs, compliance, legal, marketing, operational management and outside resources. The key is to start with something manageable, such as having a sample of operational managers deliver two or three key points on a risk topic (e.g. retaliation), and then evaluate the effectiveness of the approach and build on that experience. <br /><br /><strong>Can you share any standard outlines which make for an "effective" ethics program in the same way that regulators give guidance on what constitutes an effective compliance program?</strong><br /><br />
I wouldn't draw such a clear distinction between ethics and compliance, because the regulators don't. <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP541" title="As mentioned in the webinar">As mentioned in the webinar</a>, you cannot effectively implement a compliance program without a culture of ethics. Working on building, improving, and nurturing a culture of ethics is a key aspect of any successful compliance program. Assessing and addressing culture issues, such as fear of retaliation or a belief that there is no organizational justice, should be a major piece of any risk assessment to evaluate the program. If your assessment does not include a culture assessment component in the scope, it is probably not covering your needs. <br /><br /><strong>How can a company measure the "value and/or effectiveness" of their Compliance or Risk Management Program?<br /></strong><br />
The framework discussed in the last half hour of the webinar, I believe, is a good place to start. I would leverage whatever has been done in the past, including enterprise risk management (ERM), or an audit process that touches on compliance issues or compliance program components, and then consider building out a compliance assessment model using the Sentencing Guidelines as a broad standard to develop findings. If you lack the resources (primarily time) to develop your own model and methodology, I'd investigate third-party models. </p>
<p><strong>What programs should be included under the Compliance Department in a hospital? (ie, RAC, 340B, Contracts, etc.)<br /></strong><br />
As mentioned in the webinar, I think that it's hard to draw bright lines - particularly when discussing areas that overlap with “regulatory” compliance. There are two things to keep in mind here: <br /><br />
First, there is no one-size-fits-all. HHS OIG, as well as other regulators, have areas and issues they expect to be addressed, but they (generally) also recognize that all organizations are different. I think you start with determining (best you can) what peer organizations include in their assessments. From past experience with a regional hospital organization, I can tell we did include the contracting process/systems and PHI/PII compliance, as well as a broad overview of payment compliance systems/process (Medicare/Medicaid/Pharma).</p>
<p>This was along with the sorts of items all organizations would consider (training, monitoring, written standards, etc.). There are likely going to be things you'll want to include that peers won't include based on your particular risks (the critical nature of the system/process, the potential severity of a breech or failure, etc.). And there are going to be things that peers focus on that you won't. It's important to evaluate each individual organization's risk universe to accurately make these determinations. It's hard to know what the scope is without going through the evaluation.<br /><br />
Second, you don't have to do it all - or do it all at once.  If you develop a methodology for assessment, it could end up being a 2-3 year process where you cover roughly a third of the program per year, for example. Maybe, as with audit, the components of this rolling assessment change and certain components, because of their risk/criticality, are covered more frequently (e.g. perhaps handling of PHI/data sec is a yearly review and looking at the investigation/discipline process is every third year).<br /><br />
To give the lawyerly answer: it all depends. You really have to look hard at the potential risks you face and then make a determination about what you are going to cover and how. This often involves having to draw a line somewhere. I think the key is making sure that drawing that line is thoughtfully done.<br /><br /><strong>What are best practices for managing and monitoring the numerous sets of regulations for changes, assessing for impact, and implementing action plans, given that emerging regulations come from many sources and impact multiple departments?<br /></strong><br />
There are systems out there you can use to manage this process. For many organizations, particularly in highly regulated spaces (insurance, for example), turning to electronic systems to manage the flow and make sure a broad group of resources throughout the enterprise are aware of the impact, understand the implementation and can communicate the status and results is the only way to manage it. SAI offers <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/compliance_and_risk/compliance_360/" title="regulatory compliance and risk solutions">regulatory compliance and risk solutions</a>, for example, that organizations have used for this purpose in the past.<br /><br /><strong>Does the DOJ's policy of not prosecuting companies based on FAQs and other guidance that haven't been subjected to notice-and-comment rulemaking affect the DOL's expectations regarding ethics and compliance?<br /></strong><br />
A rule of thumb regarding compliance expectations, as with anything else, is to make sure that you are conforming with the more restrictive expectations regarding your program. It is unlikely that the Department of Labor, or any agency that has specific requirements, will be swayed by the DOJ's stated expectations if they don't address the issue or are less restrictive. And even if such an argument could be made and was successful, in most cases, it's probably easier and far cheaper to comply with the restriction in the first place.<br />
 <br />
For example, the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) include a lot of requirements that overlap with our general understanding of compliance program expectations (e.g. oversight, written standards, periodic evaluation), but also have a very specific rule about hotline/helpline information being posted publicly in all common work areas operated by government contractors, as well as on their websites. So, to be in compliance with the FAR rules, they have to have very specific hotline poster regimes (see 48 CFR 52.203-14). That sort of very specific admonishment regarding posters in work areas and website notices doesn't exist in any DOJ guidance (so far), and you can imagine a program that is “effective” under the DOJ guidance but then still technically out-of-compliance with FAR. I don't know of any contractor that wouldn't post the posters and notices.</p>

In some cases it has reached scaremongering proportions, with much focus on the new €20M / $25M USD penalties for non-compliance that will be available to regulators. <strong>But is it really that bad or are we just surfing the crest of a prime sales and marketing opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>In its guidance on preparing for GDPR, the Information Commissioner's Office advocates a measured approach saying “Many of the GDPR's main concepts and principles are much the same as those in the current Data Protection Act (DPA), so if you are complying properly with the current law then most of your approach to compliance will remain valid under the GDPR and can be the starting point to build from.”</p>
<p>In this series we'll be offering a practical six-step plan to help you achieve GDPR compliance in the remaining weeks leading up to May 25<sup>th</sup>, focusing on the key activities that you can realistically complete and that will put you (or keep you) on the path to GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>Each of these steps will be covered in more detail in our weekly posts and they are also set out in our template GDPR compliance project plan which you can download <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP943" title="here">here</a>. Below is a closer look at step 1: scoping and mobilisation.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/6%20Checkpoints%20On%20The%20Path%20To%20GDPR%20Compliance.png" /></div><h3>Step 1: Scoping and Mobilisation</h3>
<h5>(otherwise known as 'failing to plan is planning to fail')</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>If you haven't already got your GDPR compliance project plan up and running, we suggest you start by <strong>scoping and planning</strong> your activities and deciding how to mobilise the right resources. To decide what you need to do, perform a gap analysis in your existing program by considering the differences between the current and new legislation. This will give you a sense of your organization's 'GDPR readiness'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To start, here are a few key questions worth considering:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><em>Do you have processes in place to conduct the required Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)?</em></li></ul>
<p>While privacy impact assessments have been recommended best practice for some time, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/">Article 35</a> of the GDPR now mandates DPIAs in a number of circumstances.  To conduct an effective DPIA you, of course, need a sound appreciation of what personal data you hold in your organization, what processing activities you conduct, and what data flows and transfers are taking place.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><em>Are your consents in order?</em></li></ul>
<p>Where you are relying on consent as the lawful basis for processing data, are you able to demonstrate that you meet the requirements of <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/">Article 7</a> with regard to clarity, accessibility and ease of withdrawal? A best practice here is to audit existing materials and processes where consent is currently gathered from data subjects, and to review the language and process used.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><em>Do you have a process in place to 'forget' data subjects on request?</em></li></ul>
<p>Again, the right to erasure is not an entirely new concept but <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Article 17</a> of the GDPR aims to give data subjects greater control over their personal data. This includes the right to have data controllers erase personal data, cease further dissemination and, in some cases, have third parties cease processing. Your audit of the personal data your organization holds and the flow of personal data both within your organization and between your organization and third parties will be critical to implementing an effective erasure process.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><em>Do you need a DPO?</em></li></ul>
<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-37-gdpr/">Article 37</a> of the GDPR sets out the circumstances in which an organization must appoint a Data Protection Officer. Even if you are not required to appoint a DPO, now is a good time to review the available resources within your organization that can be assigned to assuring GDPR compliance, to engage key stakeholders, and to assign and document roles and responsibilities for data protection.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><em>Are you confident that you can notify a data breach within 72 hours?</em></li></ul>
<p> Do your employees understand how to recognize a data breach and know what to do if one occurs?  Do you have appropriate systems in place to ensure that the necessary workflow can be completed within 72 hours? Compliance with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/">Article 33</a> will have both training and procedural impacts.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><em>Do you have systems and processes in place to securely and efficiently transmit personal data to another controller?</em></li></ul>
<p>The new right to data portability set out in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">Article 20</a> of the GDPR affords data subjects the right to have their personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another. This will, of course, need to be done securely and in a manner that also respects the requirements of <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Article 17</a>, the right to erasure and the requirement in paragraph 1e of <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> for data to be kept no longer than necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A thorough readiness assessment will lay the foundation for a pragmatic plan to close the gaps between your current data protection program and the requirements of the GDPR. SAI Global's governance risk and compliance software can help. It contains several modules tailored to meet the requirements of GDPR including a comprehensive readiness assessment tool that includes key stakeholder surveys, action tracking, and project management capabilities.</p>

Discover SAI Global&#39;s legal, modern, and engaging sexual harassment training modules.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"></p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/2.png" /></div><p><em>As a partner at Quarles &amp; Brady LLP, and SAI Global subject matter expert for over a decade, Mike Fischer has worked with instructional designers and writers in developing scores of scenarios addressing the sexual harassment and misconduct issues which arise every day in worksites all over the world. </em></p>
<p>Over the past twenty years, I've conducted hundreds of sexual harassment training sessions in offices around the country, so trust me when I tell you that nobody really thinks they need to sit through another round of sexual harassment training. The rolling eyes, tapping feet, broad smirks and off-center stares all say “I know what sexual harassment is.” But the #MeToo movement and headlines in the news say something else. It's something that those of us conducting such training have known all along. <br /><br />
Sexual harassment hasn't gone away, and people have a harder time identifying what it is than they think. Defining and identifying harassment may not seem particularly complicated until you dive in and explore how it arises, both physically and emotionally. And what employees should do when it does. <br /><br />
When is a hug no longer OK? Is it harassment when an employee gets offended after overhearing two guys bragging about their weekend exploits? Does it matter if the person overhearing this conversation is male or female? Does a company have any right or business stepping in when an employee sends suggestive texts or pictures from the privacy of his bedroom, in the middle of the night?  <br /><br />
When developing ethics and compliance training content around harassment and misconduct, hundreds of such scenarios are evaluated and considered. The right answers to these questions aren't always intuitive, vary between culture and industry, and are even more challenging in business environments that place a premium on privacy or don't encourage speaking up. As we sift through those scenarios, I not only provide a legal overview but also weigh in on the credibility of the scenarios themselves. <br /><br />
It's not something I come to cold. I moonlight as the chief theater critic for Milwaukee's daily newspaper; I see hundreds of stage performances each year, and I've written thousands of reviews. I've long recognized what many lawyers forget: for the law to make sense to those who must follow it, the scenarios through which it's presented need to be credible and interesting as well as informative.<br /><br />
And yes: Those scenarios simultaneously must explain the law. My legal review of the scenarios in this content therefore necessarily entails ensuring that SAI Global's courses correctly define harassment and retaliation; what constitutes a hostile environment and how one reports harassment; the consequences of supervisor liability and protection against third-party harassment. <br /><br />
Even before the SAI Global designers begin scripting various scenarios, we spend hours together on conference calls and with outlines, hammering out how we're going to explain sometimes complicated legal concepts to ensure they're readily understood. During the creation process, I'll review several drafts of every script, sharpening legal definitions and ensuring quiz questions cover the legal bases, all while helping refine the scenarios themselves.    <br /><br /><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP947" title="SAI Global's latest ethics and compliance training and content">SAI Global's latest ethics and compliance training and content</a>, being released in April 2018, reflects all the lessons we've learned over the years and feedback we've received from the Fortune 1000 companies that trust us to help them address this subject. <br /><br />
These training modules make clear that when an employee is being harassed, it's everyone's business. An injury to one truly is an injury to all, and a culture in which some people can be treated disrespectfully winds up making everyone less safe. SAI Global has long included a component within its sexual harassment training courses involving bullying; picking on people because they're different encourages the sort of toxic environment in which employees are singled out because they're a particular gender or ethnicity. When an employer stops bullying, it's also taking preventive measures to stop harassment, and instead promoting a welcoming and safe environment in which employees learn from difference rather than ridiculing it.<br /><br />
From a legal perspective, a plaintiff must scale a high hurdle to establish legally cognizable harassment, which requires that conduct be demonstrably severe or pervasive, in a manner that a reasonable person in the victim's position would find offensive. That means the offhand sexist joke here, or the innuendo there, usually won't by themselves be enough to make the grade, despite being demeaning and wrong. But there are prudential and moral reasons why such conduct shouldn't - really, can't - be ignored. </p>
<p>Viewed pragmatically, even an isolated comment, proposition, or touch can serve as evidence - bolstering a plaintiff's sexual harassment case, regardless of whether those one-off incidents are themselves sufficient to establish legal harassment. Viewed morally, such behavior is flat-out wrong, regardless of whether it officially rises to the level of legal harassment. Left unchecked, such behavior and incidents are also likely to multiply, spreading their toxic influence.<br /><br />
These learning experiences should regularly point out what constitutes legal harassment. But they also aim to do more, offering a value-add in which we simultaneously assist organizations in promoting a culture of respect predicated on the golden rule: do unto others as you'd have them do unto you. That's good business. It's also the right thing to do.</p>

There are only a few weeks left before the legislation comes into force and there is still a lot that you can achieve between now and May 25th to set your organization on the path to GDPR compliance.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/119624_GDPR_Blog__Week_2_blog_header_640x340.png" /></div><p>In this series of blog posts, we are looking at six practical steps you can take over the coming weeks to build a robust GDPR compliance program.  These are:</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/6%20Checkpoints%20On%20The%20Path%20To%20GDPR%20Compliance.png?n=2613" /></div><p>You can see the first post in this series (GDPR: 6 Reasons to be Cheerful?) <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/news_and_resources/industry_news/gdpr_6_reasons_to_be_cheerful/" title="about GDPR scoping and mobilization here.">about GDPR scoping and mobilization here.</a> <br /><br />
In this second post we'll look at step 2 in our <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP943" title="FREE GDPR project plan">FREE GDPR project plan</a>, we will explore one of the fundamental requirements of GDPR, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/" title="Article 30">Article 30</a>. Article 30 requires data controllers and processors and, where applicable, their representatives, to maintain a record of processing activities.  Record keeping requirements are extensive and many organizations will, of course, be both data controllers and data processors.  <br /><br /></p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Chart1%20GDPR%20(2).jpg" /></div><p>At first sight, this looks like an onerous task.  However, once you have put in place systems to comply with Article 30 you will have created the basis for compliance with many other aspects of the GDPR.  You will have </p>
<ul><li><strong>audited</strong> the personal data in your organization and the systems and services used to manage them;</li><li><strong>documented</strong> and risk-assessed third parties involved in the management or processing of personal data;</li><li><strong>mapped</strong> and categorized data flows including cross-border data transfers;</li><li>considered the <strong>technical and organizational security measures</strong> in place.</li></ul>









  


<p>In effect you will have created a '<strong>golden record</strong>' - that is, a single source of truth that will enable compliance with many other aspects of GDPR such as:</p>
<ul><li>data protection impact assessments</li><li>data protection by design and by default</li><li>subject access management including the right to be forgotten and the right to portability</li><li>breach management</li><li>privacy notices and consents</li></ul>
<p>Although the case for prioritizing the mapping and recording of data processing activities is strong, it is an aspect of GDPR with which many organizations are struggling.  At a recent <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/14951/304543?utm_campaign=webcasts-search-results-feed&amp;utm_content=SAI%20Global&amp;utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web" title="webinar">webinar</a> hosted by SAI Global, only 18% of the audience said that they had finished mapping their data processing activities. A little more than half (55%) said they had started but were finding the exercise challenging; and a further 18% didn't know what the status of their data mapping was.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/GDPR%20bar%20chart%20Have%20you%20started%20mapping%20your%20processing%20activities.png" /></div><p>Where to start…<br />
Gathering all of the required information in a thorough and systematic way and implementing appropriate systems to record and manage the information in a dynamic business environment is not a simple undertaking.  My recommendation for getting off to a good start is not based on technology or processes, but instead on people.  First and foremost, ensure you have all of the right stakeholders involved to capture an enterprise-wide view of your processing activities.  No matter who ultimately owns the data privacy risk, many parts of the organization are involved in managing it - make sure you bring them to the table.  For example, consider the following:  <br /><br /></p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Chart1%20GDPR%203%20(3)%20who%20to%20involve.png" /></div><p>Once key stakeholders are identified and briefed, they can take part  in the systematic identification and recording of what data are held in which systems and documenting the processes and data flows involved.<br /><br />
At a basic level this may simply involve the distribution of a structured questionnaire to capture the information required by Article 30.  Results from our webinar suggest that many organizations (71% of our respondents) are relying on this essentially manual approach to data mapping:<br /><br /></p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/GDPR%20bar%20chart%20How%20do%20you%20identify%20which%20poersonal%20data%20you%20hold.png" /></div><p>While this may be a good starting point, the personal data landscape is complex and fragmented, particularly for larger organizations.  Automation using one of a number of data discovery tools on the market can make the process both quicker and more efficient. </p>
<p><br />
 The outputs of both automated and manual data discovery exercises can be consumed by  SAI Global's GDPR compliance software which also includes a structured database and pre-defined workflows to assist with Article 30 compliance.  SAI's solution creates a comprehensive, central register of processing activities; maps information flows and information assets that hold personal data using customizable, pre-defined forms and uses business intelligence tools to produce insightful analytics.</p>

Understand how to protect your organisation.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/120543_GDPR_Blog_Series_Week_3_Blog_header_640x340.png" /></div><p>With just weeks to go to 25<sup>th</sup> May the internet (and my inbox) is full of technical solutions to the GDPR compliance challenge.  Of course, technology has a vital role to play in protecting personal data.  However, in this third post in our series on steps to GDPR compliance I want to focus on the biggest data privacy risk of all - people!  </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/6%20Checkpoints%20On%20The%20Path%20To%20GDPR%20Compliance.png?n=8780" /></div><p>A 2016 <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450297535/Human-error-causes-more-data-loss-than-malicious-attacks">Freedom of Information Request</a> to the UK Information Commissioner's Office revealed that human error accounted for almost two thirds (62%) of incidents reported to the ICO.  A similar picture emerges in the US where <a href="https://www.comptia.org/resources/trends-in-information-security-study">CompTIA's</a> survey of trends in information security estimates that human error is a factor in 52% of security breaches.</p>
<p>The role of human error in data privacy and security breaches is both significant and well documented.  But what's surprising is that this is not new information.  Just a little digging into well respected surveys and reports going back many years shows that human error has <em>always</em> been a major cause of data privacy incidents.  We definitely know what the problem is, but it seems we're not having much success in solving it.</p>
<p>When it comes to the 'human factor' in data protection we immediately think of the central role of training and communication and I usually see organisations doing three things:</p>
<ul><li>We produce policies setting out expected standards of behaviour - and sometimes have employees 'sign off' agreeing that they have read the policy and agree to abide by it.</li><li>We roll out data protection training - often an annual, or even less frequent, event depending on how successful we are at squeezing into the company's training calendar</li><li>We ensure we have an audit trail showing who completed the training and when - meaning that, if all else fails, we can rely on the 'bad apple' defence</li></ul>
<p>What could possibly go wrong? </p>
<p>Of course, policies, training and audit trails are absolutely essential elements of an effective GDPR compliance programme.  My concern is less about <strong>what</strong> we do and more about <strong>how</strong> we do it to ensure that we actually drive the behavioural change that is so clearly needed.  If we are really going to address the human factor, we need to understand <strong>why</strong> people don't follow policies, <strong>why</strong> they don't change their behaviour and <strong>why</strong> they are so careless with such valuable data.</p>
<h2>Start with Why</h2>
<p>A recent survey by <a href="http://news.gallup.com/reports/220313/state-global-workplace-2017.aspx?utm_source=link_wwwv9&amp;utm_campaign=item_231668&amp;utm_medium=copy">Gallup</a> concluded that the world has an employee engagement crisis.  “Worldwide, the percentage of adults who work full time for an employer and are engaged at work -- they are highly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace -- is just 15%.”  In short, this means that significant numbers of employees simply don't care about what happens at their company. </p>
<p>In the context of data protection, this finding suggests that we need to re-think our approach to the engagement tactics we use in our training and communications.  Typically, I see two approaches:  the CEO message (“I care so you should care”) and the fear factor (“do this or else”).  I agree that tone at the top is vitally important, as is an appreciation of the scale of data privacy risk in businesses.  However, in order to change employee attitudes and drive behavior we need something more.  Simon Sinek's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPYeCltXpxw">Ted Talk</a> about inspiring leadership is helpful here.  Sinek explains that much human decision making is controlled not by rational and objective analysis but by the more primitive limbic system which deals with emotion and feeling.  As advertising guru Robin Wight says “The causal role of conscious thought has been vastly overrated, and what we are in fact is not rational creatures, but rationalizing creatures.” </p>
<p>Perhaps this is one of the reasons that we are seeing a dialogue emerging around the relationship between compliance in the workplace and shared human values.  After all, there is a very human cost to non-compliance in most risk areas, and data privacy is no exception.  Central to data privacy compliance is a very powerful theme of protection which, if personalized, can engage and motivate employees.  Taking a personal, human view of the risk means we can help employees protect their own personal data and keep their families safe and this, in turn, may drive more compliant behaviors at work.</p>
<h2>So what does good look like?</h2>
<p>Training and communications are a central part of GDPR compliance and, potentially, one of the most effective ways of addressing the 'human error' factor.  Here's a short checklist of things to consider for an effective GDPR awareness programme:</p>

And Australia is no different. If your organization is one of the many <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/news_and_resources/industry_news/7_things_you_need_to_know_about_australia_s_mandatory_data_breach_reporting_scheme/" title="affected by these new laws that came into effect on 23 February 2018,">affected by these new laws that came into effect on 23 February 2018,</a> your people should be a key focus in your continuing efforts to ensure compliance. <br /><br />
Even with the best IT security technology in place, it's ultimately a person that's going to recognize a data breach and raise a red flag. And it's your frontline people, rather than security experts, who bear a large part of the burden of protecting data. <br /><br />
Here are four steps toward getting your people on board and managing the risks around data breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create an authentic corporate culture </strong><br /><br />
A clear and authentic message about the protection of data must come from the top, with a strong and proactive compliance program that goes to the very heart of protecting data. Middle managers should communicate the reasons to support the message that data protection is extremely important to the organization. They should also go one step further by walking the talk and, if someone does raise a potential breach, handling any reports appropriately. <br /><br />
By communicating the behaviors you want to see in your staff, and empowering others to speak up when things go wrong, you encourage the actions you want to see in staff when it comes to managing data.<br /><br /><strong>Step 2: Define clear responsibilities</strong><br /><br />
Make sure everybody knows the part they play in identifying and reporting a breach. This includes handling reports, assessing the impact of a breach, and following up with remedial actions and potential notification to the regulator.<br /><br />
Responsibilities for your frontline employees are going to be very different to those with specialist roles, so cascade your information throughout your organization to support the clear distinctions in responsibilities. Most staff probably don't need to know the fine details of the legislative provisions. Instead, a practical focus on the principles of the legislation is important: how to identify and detect a breach and how to report a breach. <br /><br /><strong>Step 3: Provide support with clear processes</strong><br /><br />
Clear responsibilities need to be supported by simple processes - and you need to make sure the processes are plainly communicated to the right people.<br /><br />
For example, in Australia there are several things that need to be completed as part of Australia's Notifiable Data Breach Scheme. These include making sure the information is contained once it's identified that a possible breach has been uncovered, putting remedial actions in place following a breach, and making sure a notification is made when required. Having clear processes for these things is important, along with clear and updated policies.<br /><br /><strong>Step 4: Deliver a campaign of training and awareness</strong><br /><br />
Consistent and clear messaging and communications about data privacy helps to keep the topic and the risk area top of mind for everybody. <br /><br />
Key in this endeavor is a robust training program that addresses prevention, detection, containment, reporting, and notification. Training for the sake of delivering training on an annual basis doesn't work anymore, whether it's a one-stop or annual refresh. Enable a campaign-based approach with training and awareness and communication tools - not just training courses - to remind people on a regular basis of the importance of data privacy and the organization's support of data privacy. <br /><br /><strong>Data breach prevention: the final step</strong><br /><br />
So, you've put all your efforts into making sure you've got the message about protection of data coming from both the top and middle. You've defined responsibilities clearly, established processes and invested in robust training. A final, and important, element in the equation is incorporating 'speak-up' culture in any training program. If people - your biggest data breach risk - fear reporting a breach or an incident to security… you've failed. <br /><br />
Remember, your people may be your greatest data breach risk but they also provide the opportunity to detect and prevent serious data breaches.<br /><br />

At the heart of the new regulation is a risk-based approach that, if properly implemented, can make for proportionate and effective compliance programmes that make best use of your available resources.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/129226%20Cybersecurity%20month_Blog_header_640x340_GDPR-ABC.jpg" /></div><p>This fourth post in our GDPR blog series explores a pragmatic risk-based approach to <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/gdpr_6_reasons_to_be_cheerful/" title="GDPR compliance">GDPR compliance</a> and examines some aspects of the GDPR that can help to focus your activities to drive the best returns on your compliance investment. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/6%20Checkpoints%20On%20The%20Path%20To%20GDPR%20Compliance.png?n=1966" /></div><p>There are four aspects of GDPR that are particularly helpful in guiding a risk-based approach:<br />
 • Article 30 - Records of processing activities<br />
 • Article 25 - Data protection by design and default<br />
 • Article 35 - Data protection Impact Assessment<br />
 • Article 32 - Security of processing<br /><br />
 Here's how I believe they fit together in three steps to a risk-based approach to GDPR: </p>
<h2><strong>A. Build a risk register</strong></h2>
<p>Article 30 requires data controllers and processors to maintain a record of processing activities (you can read more about it in my  post on Article 30 <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/news_and_resources/industry_news/gdpr__the_truth_is_out_there_%E2%80%93_mapping_the_personal_data_universe/" title="here">here</a>).  Do this systematically to build a comprehensive record of processing activities by adding new processing activities as they are designed.  This will create a strong foundation for assessing the risks to personal data in your organization and is a great starting point for compliance with both Article 25 - Data Protection by Default and by Design and Article 35 - Data Protection Impact Assessments. <br /><br />
 Both Article 25 and Article 35 include an element of risk assessment and risk control through technical and organizational measures.  Therefore, the record of processing activities you build for Article 30 can also become your risk register. This will enable you to capture data protection risks, the outcome of your risk assessments, and the technical and organizational controls that are implemented to mitigate the identified risks centrally<br /><br /></p>
<h2><strong>B. Assess the risk</strong></h2>
<p>Compliance with Article 25 requires you to assess and document the risks associated with processing activities (ideally in your central register of processing activities).  Risks are typically rated as high, medium or low, based on a combination of the likelihood of the risk occurring and the severity of the consequences for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.  <br /><br />
 Article 35 gives guidance on what constitutes high-risk processing activities and mandates a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) prior to the processing where high-risk activities are identified.<br /><br />
 Both the UK <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/" title="Information Commissioner's Office">Information Commissioner's Office</a> and the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/news.cfm?item_type=1358" title="Article 29 Data Protection Working Party">Article 29 Data Protection Working Party</a> provide useful guidance about the conduct of DPIAs.  Whatever methodology you choose to follow, it is vital to ensure that you have an adequate record of your DPIA risk assessment process and outcomes. <br /><br /></p>
<h2><strong>C. Implement controls</strong></h2>
<p>Risk assessment is an ongoing procedure that reflects the dynamic technical environment where personal data is typically processed.  As risks are identified it is important to ensure that proportionate and effective controls are put in place to mitigate them.  Article 32 gives guidance on the sort of technical and organizational measures that may be required, depending on the level of risk identified.  Again, the process of determining and implementing technical and organizational measures should be clearly documented and linked to the central risk register you will build to comply with Article 30.<br /><br /></p>
<h2><strong>Working Together</strong></h2>
<p>Enabling a risk-based approach to data protection requires the systematic application of technical and procedural measures, as described previously.  But the success of these measures is likely to rely on building effective human networks within your organization as well as external parties.  Below is a sample description of key roles necessary for this change:<br /><br /><strong>Legal / IT / Risk / Audit<br /></strong>GDPR has both legal and technical dimensions.  Understanding and interpreting the law and management of the legal risk is likely a Legal or Compliance team responsibility.  However, the IT and IT Security organizations are key enablers of the technical and organizational measures that can be implemented to protect data.<br /><br />
 It's also likely that your IT Security organization is already complying with, or at least guided by, standards such as <a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html" title="ISO27001">ISO27001</a> which already aligns well with many GDPR requirements.</p>
<p>Risk and Audit departments are experts in risk management, and are often informed by standards such as <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html" title="ISO31000">ISO31000</a>. These standards can advise on building risk registers, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risk.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties</strong><br />
 It is likely that much processing activity is being conducted by external data processors on behalf of your organization.  In these cases, the data controller is very much still accountable for Data Protection Impact Assessments.  The most effective way to manage the risk assessment and oversight of the processing done by third parties is through the use of a third-party risk management tool.  Check if your IT department is already using an IT <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/compliance_and_risk/digital_risk_software/applications/vendor_risk_management/" title="Vendor Risk Management">Vendor Risk Management</a> tool.</p>
<p><strong>Employees</strong><br />
 It's vital that all employees understand their role in protecting others' personal data.  Anyone involved in the design, implementation or management of processes and systems that handle personal data can pose a risk. It's important they understand and comply with the requirement for data protection by design and default and data privacy impact assessments.  Make this part of your targeted <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/res/saiglob_mkt_prod1/4f1fbd537dc737d2c03c666c4ee4663d.pdf" title="GDPR training">GDPR training</a> campaign.<br /><br /></p>
<h2><strong>Don't reinvent the wheel</strong></h2>
<p>There's a lot to do and not long to go before GDPR comes into force.  Building entirely new systems and processes from scratch can be both costly and time consuming.  SAI Global's best practice based out-of-the-box GDPR software solution and GDPR Learning enables a risk-based approach to GDPR compliance that can be quickly and easily implemented.</p>

It looks at how the Personal Property Securities (PPS) Act and trust law interact in the context of insolvency. </p>
<p>Amerind traded solely as the trustee of a trading trust. It owned no assets and was entitled to be indemnified from the trust asset for liabilities it incurred on behalf of the trust.</p>
<p>When Amerind's finance facilities held with its bank faced termination, the bank appointed receivers and subsequently, the amounts owing to the bank were fully discharged. Later, Amerind was wounded up following a creditors' resolution.</p>
<p>Under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Scheme, the Commonwealth paid $3.8 million to Amerind's former employees in accrued wages and entitlements. After the bank was paid, there was a surplus of around $1.6 million. The Commonwealth sought to be repaid as a priority creditor out of the “circulating assets” according to the statutory insolvency distribution regime in section 433 the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>The trial judge found that Amerind's right of indemnity was not the property of the company, so the priority regime did not apply to the surplus. The Commonwealth appealed this decision.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal found that the right of indemnity was the property of the company. The Commonwealth was entitled to be repaid ahead of other creditors as the priority regime applied. </p>
<p>What does “circulating asset” mean? The Australian Financial Security Authority explains this PPS Act concept well. A circulating asset will typically be either an account or inventory, among other particular types of property, over which the grantor of the security interest retains control of the property. In other cases, collateral would be a circulating asset where the secured party had given the grantor authority for the transfer of the collateral in the ordinary course of the business free of the security interest.[3] In this case, the trade account held by the company was a circulating asset as it has authority to deal with the account in the ordinary course of its business.</p>
<p>So, what have we learnt? The Court of Appeal held that the relevant asset to be assessed for the purpose of applying section 433 to a corporate trustee is not the right of indemnity, but it is the assets making up the trust and subject to the right of indemnity. This, is <strong>lesson #1</strong>. Further, the time for determining whether an asset is a circulating asset is not at the time the security interest was created, but it is at the time the receiver takes possession of the asset. And this, is <strong>lesson #2</strong>.</p>
<p>These are valuable lessons for lawyers and insolvency practitioners, especially those dealing with the insolvency of corporate trustees. </p>
<p>Finally, <strong>lesson #3</strong> is don't forget to search the PPS Register to find out if an asset or a company that is relevant to your transaction is the subject of any security interests - this is an important due diligence step that should not be missed.

This rises to two-thirds among medium firms (66%) and large firms (68%).”  The study also found that breaches are more likely than average in businesses that hold electronic personal data on customers (rising from 46% to 51%). </p>
<blockquote><p>A personal data breach can be broadly defined as a security incident that has affected the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data. In short, there will be a personal data breach whenever any personal data is lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed.</p><p>ICO Guide to the General Data Protection Regulations</p></blockquote><p>The fact that your organization has, more or less, a fifty-fifty chance of experiencing a breach in any 12-month period brings into sharp focus new <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/" title="GDPR requirements">GDPR requirements</a> to report certain types of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities within 72 hours.  As a first step, you should be reviewing and improving your organization's systems and processes for incident management. <br /><br />
Of course, not all incidents are breaches and not all breaches are notifiable.  The UK Information Commissioner's Office provides some useful <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/" title="guidance">guidance</a> here.  The requirement to report a breach to your Supervisory Authority applies to personal data breaches, which are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.  Furthermore, if the breach is likely to result in a <strong>high</strong> risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals then the individuals concerned must also be informed without <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-86/" title="undue delay">undue delay</a>. Your DPIAs will be an important tool to help you determine the likelihood and severity of breaches associated with your data processing activities - read last week's blog about the role of DPIAs in a <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/a_risk-based_approach_to_gdpr__it_s_as_easy_as_a__b__c/" title="risk-based approach to GDPR">risk-based approach to GDPR</a>.<br /><br />
In practice, this means that an organization needs in place an effective mechanism to:</p>
<p>1. capture all security incidents; <br />
2. quickly evaluate if they constitute a personal data breach;<br />
3. determine if the breach is notifiable to the relevant supervisory authority;<br />
4. determine if the individuals concerned need to be informed; and<br />
5. take action!</p>
<p><strong>Hand, Eye and Stakeholder Coordination</strong><br />
A theme running through most of this <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/search/search/?q=GDPR" title="blog series">blog series</a> has been the need for coordination and collaboration across all relevant stakeholders within your organization to ensure an adequate response to GDPR.  This is certainly the case with breach management and notifications.  In terms of capturing incidents, organizations often have multiple incident reporting channels for compliance, HR and security issues - all of these could be the first point of entry for learning about a potentially notifiable breach.  Consider how to monitor all of these channels or, better still, how to harmonize your organization's <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/compliance_and_risk/compliance_360/apps/incident_management_software/" title="incident reporting tools">incident reporting tools</a> and processes.<br /><br />
In addition, many security breaches occur as a result of malicious, external attacks that are first detected, and responded to, by the technical controls implemented by IT security departments. It is vital that IT Security, Legal, Compliance and Privacy departments have clear and agreed procedures for monitoring and evaluating these attacks for potential notifiable breaches.</p>
<p><strong>The right tools for the job</strong><br />
A 72-hour window for taking action on notifiable breaches will be challenging for many organizations given the sheer number of attacks on businesses and level of coordination required to detect and respond to them.  This is one area of GDPR where technology can be a key enabler of compliance.  Consider implementing an <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/compliance_and_risk/compliance_360/apps/incident_management_software/" title="incident management system">incident management system</a> that can:</p>

<p><strong>Changing workplace behaviors</strong><br />
No matter what technical controls you put in place, the success of your breach management system will rely in large part on the knowledge and behaviors of employees.  No doubt most organizations are rolling out GDPR awareness training - but with what outcomes in mind?</p>
<ul><li>Will your training help employees recognize a personal data breach?  </li><li>Will they understand the urgency around breach management? </li><li>Will it help them know what to <strong>do</strong> about possible incidents?</li><li>Will they be able and willing to take action promptly?  </li></ul>
<p>The content and design of your GDPR training campaign is key to ensuring the right outcomes for managing data privacy risk.  (For more information, read our <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/news_and_resources/industry_news/gdpr__a_human_firewall_is_your_best_untapped_defence/" title="blog">blog</a> about GDPR training or listen to our recent <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/1600617738061163010" title="webinar">webinar</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong><br />
Do you really want to wait for that notifiable breach to happen before you find out if your breach management system is going to work?  Learning from best practices in the world of health and safety, information security teams are now increasingly running <strong>'fire drills'</strong> to make sure that systems, processes and people are in place to respond effectively to security incidents.  Likewise, running GDPR breach fire drills will help you to test your system, identify any gaps, and close them before the real thing occurs. Because it's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.</p>

<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Dick%20Kusserow%20guest%20blog%20post%20on%20SAI%20blog.png" /></div><p>SAI Global and <a href="http://compliance.com/">Strategic Management Services</a> recently completed the ninth annual Healthcare Compliance Benchmark Survey. The survey results are compiled in the annual report, and the most eye-opening section of all to me is about priorities. There is a mismatch between what compliance offices, as practitioners, see as the most important priorities, compared to the regulatory agencies' priority perspectives, like the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Department of Justice (DoJ).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The largest challenge stated by <strong>compliance officers</strong> is addressing <a href="http://compliance.com/publications/claims-processing-ongoing-monitoring-auditing-improves-revenue-prevents-costly-errors/">ongoing monitoring and ongoing auditing</a> of high-risk areas. Overwhelmingly, respondents reported dealing with data breaches as their highest-ranked priority, with two-thirds citing HIPAA Security/Cyber-security, and over half for HIPAA Privacy as their number one concern. This represented the biggest change from last year's survey. Coupled with this was that nearly three-quarters of respondents reported the compliance office as having responsibility for HIPAA Privacy and nearly one-third having responsibility for HIPAA Security.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Troubling, though, is the fact that the number one <strong>regulatory and enforcement priority</strong> by the <strong>OIG</strong> and <strong>DOJ</strong> remain corrupt arrangements with referral sources. The second-most important priority is the issue of false claims. Together they represent virtually all the major enforcement actions and penalties and represent a far greater exposure to liabilities than security breaches. However, not only was <a href="https://compliance.com/services/physician-arrangements-reviews/">arrangement with referral sources</a> not the top high-risk area priority for compliance officers, it was ranked <em>fifth</em> in priority; and <a href="https://compliance.com/services/claims-data-analysis/">claims accuracy</a> ranked in third place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Put plainly: <strong>the survey results indicate that these top compliance high-risk areas cited by the DOJ and OIG do not coincide with respondents' highest priorities.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why The Mismatch?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Naturally, this leads one to ask: why, in the face of the priorities of the enforcement agencies are corporate compliance officers placing these high risk areas in a lower category priority? The report results and recommendations point to compliance officers realigning their priorities to be more in line with those set out by the regulatory and enforcement agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Former Inspector General, I believe that part of the reason why <a href="https://compliance.com/services/physician-arrangements-reviews/">arrangements with referral sources</a> may not receive as much attention by compliance officers is that many defer to their legal counsel for ongoing monitoring and auditing of arrangements. Yet, all arrangements will likely have involved (to one degree or another) legal counsel; and by definition, those involved in the development of arrangements cannot independently audit their work.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore, virtually all anti-kickback and Stark law enforcement actions dealt with arrangements where legal counsel had been involved. A key point is recognizing that the arrangement contract document is only one small piece of the whole picture taken into consideration by enforcement authorities. There is much more to consider, such as:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Establishing medical need for a part time physician based on evidence</li><li>Designing a method to determine selection of those who will fill the role</li><li>Determining fair market value and commercial reasonableness for the services</li><li>Ensuring all the areas of the contract have been properly filled out</li><li>Verifying performance on arrangement before payments are made </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who Conducts The Audit?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Many Compliance Officers are also concerned about their qualifications to <a href="https://compliance.com/services/claims-data-analysis/">review the claims processing system</a>, forgetting that ongoing auditing does not need to be performed by the compliance office. And frankly, it shouldn't. The compliance officer just needs to ensure that ongoing monitoring is taking place, and by which program managers. This also includes their keeping current with payment rules, translating them into written guidance, training the staff on following that guidance, and monitoring that it is being followed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The auditing can be performed by internal audit, external auditors or consultants, or any combination thereof, including staff from the compliance office. They can participate in the effort, but <a href="https://compliance.com/services/physician-arrangements-reviews/">it can be done by others</a>, as long as they are independent of the function.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those encountering resistance to compliance oversight of the <a href="https://compliance.com/services/physician-arrangements-reviews/">arrangements</a> or <a href="https://compliance.com/services/claims-data-analysis/">claims processing</a> processes, a viable option may be engaging experts in those areas to do the auditing. </p>

In this final post we examine how to document the key elements of your GDPR compliance program in a set of effective policies and procedures.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/121424_GDPR_Blog_Series_Week_6_Blog_header_640x340.png" /></div><p>Data protection legislation has been around for a long time so most organizations will have some policies and procedures in place - if nothing else, <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/a_risk-based_approach_to_gdpr__it_s_as_easy_as_a__b__c/" title="GDPR">GDPR</a> gives you a great opportunity to review and refresh these documents.</p>
<p><strong>What's in a name?</strong><br />
There is a long-standing debate in the compliance community about the difference between policies and procedures.  Here, we assume the following:  </p>
<ul><li>A <strong>policy</strong> is a guiding principle; a statement of intent and direction intended to set the tone and reflect corporate values.  A <strong>policy</strong> should be a useful support to decision making to achieve a desired outcome. </li><li>A <strong>procedure</strong>, quite simply, tells the reader <strong>how</strong> to achieve the aims of the policy.  </li></ul>
<p>In light of this distinction, you might want to consider publishing the documents separately and publish your policies more widely than your procedures.<br /><br /><strong>Who are they for?</strong><br />
Hopefully the days of policies written by lawyers for lawyers (or at least for regulators to achieve the tick in the policy box) are long gone.  <br /><br />
Generally, both data protection policies and procedures are written with employees in mind and this should impact a number of factors:</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/121424_GDPR_Blog_Series_Week_6_4_Ss_Policy_Image.png" /></div><ul><li><strong>Scope</strong>: Are you addressing the attitudinal and behavioral dimensions of your policies as well as 'the rules'?  Do your policies and procedures take into consideration local language requirements and possible cultural differences?</li><li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Is the content easily understood by a general audience? Are you avoiding overly-legalistic language?</li><li><strong>Substance</strong>: Will the content, terminology and tone of voice of your policies resonate with your audience?  Will they be perceived as authentic and in line with your organizational culture? </li><li><strong>Structure</strong>: Are your policies and particularly your procedures, organized in a manner that is easy to read and understand?  Increasingly policies and procedures are including visual design elements, examples and questions and answers to aid understanding and application.</li></ul>
<p>Transparency in business is increasingly important as a factor in consumer trust. You may also want to consider making your policies, but not your procedures, publicly available. Accordingly, you need to consider your customers and end-users as a secondary target audience.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to success</strong><br />
The content of your policies and procedures indeed needs to be accurate and legally validated but this is just one of many steps you should take to ensure that they are effective.<br /><br />
There is a strong case for 'market testing' your policies and procedures with target audience groups to ensure that you have achieved the objectives of <strong>scope, simplicity, substance</strong> and <strong>structure</strong>.<br /><br />
Consider how policies will be made available to employees.  Will they just sit on the corporate intranet waiting to be discovered or will you publicize them and make them available with modern communication tools and techniques?</p>
<p>Will you just assume the right people have read your policies or will you undertake a process of attestation?  Having employees 'sign up' to a policy certainly gives you a useful audit trail. There is some evidence that there may be additional benefits in terms of driving more compliant behaviors in the workplace.  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_on_our_buggy_moral_code" title="Dan Airley's">Dan Airley's</a> fascinating experiments in this area show that the simple act of 'signing up' to a moral code can have a significant impact on ethical behavior.<br /><br /><strong>What policies do you need?</strong><br />
Remember that there are many aspects of GDPR that intersect with an organizations' information security provisions.  It's likely that there are already policies in place that help with <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/a_risk-based_approach_to_gdpr__it_s_as_easy_as_a__b__c/" title="GDPR">GDPR</a> compliance - ensure that you know what they are and that you do not duplicate, or worse, conflict with, existing information security practices within your organization.<br /><br />
Also, ensure that your policies reflect some of the significant changes that GDPR makes to current data protection practices particularly in the areas of:</p>
<ul><li>Subject access requests including the right to be forgotten</li><li>Data disposal and deletion</li><li>Breach management</li><li>Subject Access Requests </li></ul>

It focuses on the impact to one of the key economic sectors of the country: tradies.</p>
<p><strong>1. Lower taxes with Ten Year Enterprise Plan</strong></p>
<p>The 2018-19 Federal Budget introduces a $530 tax cut for tradies and other Australians earning between $48,000 to $90,000. Also, from July 1 2018, if you're a tradie earning more than $87,000, you'll be happy to know the 32.5% tax bracket has been lifted from $87,000 to $90,000. This means you'll now be paying less tax if you earn over $87,000.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-businesses/Reducing-the-corporate-tax-rate/" title="ATO">ATO</a>, the general tax rate is proposed to gradually decrease further, right down to 25% in 2026-27.</p>
<p>If you're an ambitious tradie who is focused on growing your customer base and aiming to increase your revenue each year, the tax reductions are beneficial to you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Extension of $20,000 instant asset tax write-off</strong></p>
<p>Tradies can enjoy lower taxes for the upcoming financial year with the continuation of the $20,000 tax write-off initiative. When you purchase many types of assets to run your trade business, and the cost is less than $20,000, this expense is tax deductible within your tax return. Which means that instead of receiving the depreciation benefits over time for that asset, you'll end up with more money in your pocket sooner.</p>
<p>This simplifies things for you at tax time, as purchases such as vehicles, equipment, machinery, furniture and tools will no longer have to be deducted over a number of years.</p>
<p><strong>3. New limit on cash payments</strong></p>
<p>A new limit on cash payments is being introduced, to prevent undeclared cash payments being made or received by business owners. Trade business owners and all other businesses will be limited to making or accepting a maximum of $10,000 in cash payments starting from July 1 2019.</p>
<p><strong>4. Crackdown on illegal “phoenix” activity</strong></p>
<p>To discourage 'phoenix' activity within small businesses new rules have been introduced to help prevent business owners from taking advantage of staff and/or other entities. Common activities include not paying bills or employees wages when the business goes bust, only to operate again under a new business identity.</p>
<p>It's about business owners being held accountable for the debts they incur when they go out of business.</p>
<p><strong>5. More apprenticeship funding</strong></p>
<p>The government is investing $250 million in the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/skilling-australians-fund" title="Skilling Australians Fund">Skilling Australians Fund</a>, which will provide more funding for apprenticeships and traineeships to help encourage growth in key sectors. With more tradespeople entering the workforce, there'll be more candidates to choose from when growing your own team.</p>
<p><strong>6. Improving roads and infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>As a tradie, you're frequently on the road in your work vehicle. It's likely that you experience delays from being stuck in traffic and other related issues that could impact everyone's safety.</p>
<p>$4.2 billion dollars will be spent on Australian roads. $1 billion will specifically go towards improving congestion on our busy roads. The funding is part of a larger initiative to invest $75 billion into roads as a 10 year rolling infrastructure plan.</p>
<p>Overall, there a few good benefits for tradies in this budget.</p>
<p><strong>Handy tip:</strong> with so many transactions involved in trade businesses, it's easy to forget which ones you can claim in your tax return. Remember to include other assets like professional libraries when claiming for tools and equipment.</p>

Discover the 2 key lessons from the webinar.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"></p><p>At our recent webinar, “Data Driven Decisions - How and Why”, one thing really stood out: 100% of respondents agree that they have drawn a picture to help explain something so it is easier to understand.</p>
<p>While we have all heard “a picture is worth a thousand words”, nothing is more compelling than proof in the form of complete consensus. The result of this poll question really should not come as a surprise. After all, as we noted in the webinar, the human brain can process images 60,000 times faster than text.[1] Our brains are hard-wired to seek out patterns and trends in the things we see. It is in our nature to draw on our experience and knowledge to interpret what we are seeing? </p>
<p>But something did catch us by surprise. 80% of the poll respondents said they go directly to the registers (including the ASIC registers, the PPS Register, and the land registries of the States and Territories) for commercial information they need to make decisions, such as for providing legal, financial, restructuring or other professional advice to clients. Well, we have news for you - there is a better way! Picture this (and this is just one example), an extra pair of hands to help you verify a company's identity before ordering a report. One that you can customise by running a combined ASIC Current Company Extract and the PPSR Organisation Grantor Search. Your tailor-built report includes a summary of the commercial information from both reports, and you can have the summary in chart form. </p>
<p>As 40% of people respond better to visual information than plain text[2], this chart is a formidable tool. With the aid of visuals, you can discover otherwise hidden links using a manual search. This is empowering as you are better equipped to make the right decisions in a timely manner. In the current economic and regulatory climate - think the banking Royal Commission that is on foot and in the news almost every day - we are all under more pressure than ever to make the best possible decisions for our stakeholders. Wouldn't it be nice to de-risk tedious manual processes and gain peace of mind that you have covered all the facts, fast? Indeed, the answer is yes!</p>
<p>This takes us to a recap of the 2 key lessons of the webinar:</p>
<ul><li>1.Organisations around the world, including professional services firms and regulators, are embracing a data-driven culture to make intelligence-led decisions.</li></ul>
<ul><li>2.Commercial information management and visual information management are sought-after skills that will help organisations and professionals make the right decisions for their stakeholders.</li></ul>
<p>We are pleased that the webinar has helped attendees better understand data and information management, especially regarding the power of visualisation.

<p><em>SAI Global's ethics and compliance team hand-picks articles and content from different online publications and shares them on our blog. Here are some of the more interesting and thought-provoking articles we'd like to share from the past week or so - this time, with a specific flavor: GDPR.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>If you've somehow escaped the fevered pitch that is <strong>GDPR</strong> - you're lucky and unlucky at the same time. Lucky, in the sense that the topic (rightfully so) dominated the news cycles for all those clamoring to learn more. In fact, it was more popular (at least for a week or so) on Google than an international pop star. You're unlucky, in the sense that if you don't know anything about it, now is the time to learn. It's a sweeping change to how data and privacy are even thought about, starting (but not ending) in the EU. And if you missed out - we have you covered. <strong>Click each headline for the story.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/personal_data_is_a_fundamental_right__the_human_side_of_gdpr/"><strong><em>Personal Data is a Fundamental Right: the Human Side of GDPR</em></strong></a></p>
<p>When we interact with a device or an app (let's say we go for a run, and use <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/2/1/16945120/strava-data-tracking-privacy-military-bases">Strava</a> to track our pace and distance) - who owns that data? Strava, the app maker? Or us, the human on the run?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 2025, according to IDC, people will interact with connected devices almost 4,800 times per day, up from just 218 in 2015. Our personal data has become that much more valuable, and more vulnerable.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/05/21/forrester-cmo-explains-how-cmos-should-approach-gdpr-and-evolve-their-roles"><strong><em>How CMOs Should Approach GDPR and Evolve Their Roles</em></strong></a></p>
<p>Despite being an EU-heavy initiative, Forrester CMO <a href="https://twitter.com/vtmilligan?lang=en">Victor Mulligan</a> opines that chief marketing officers (CMOs) should assume that GDPR and any other regulations that will be introduced in the future will become the <em>global</em> law of the land.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mulligan offers this: “None of this can be done without mastering data and technology to deliver individualized experiences at scale.” Indeed. GDPR has been likened to the Y2K of privacy. We're at the dawn of a tectonic shift in the data age. And we need <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/compliance_and_risk/digital_risk_software/solution_journeys/gdpr/">all the help we can get</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/a_new_defender_in_data_privacy_the_gdpr/"><strong><em>How GDPR Links Compliance to Data Privacy and Data Protection</em></strong></a></p>
<p>While it's clear that the effects of GDPR will reach far and wide across all industries, we'll be keen to keep an eye on how this new regulation will influence Facebook, Twitter, and other global media companies that rely heavily on user data to customize experiences and deliver targeted advertising (see previous Forrester article). The most significant GDPR impact will be to these online media companies and social networks that use data-driven targeting for advertising and customization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestingnews.co.uk/gdpr-isnt-dangerous-for-machine-learning-says-gdpr-delivery-manager/"><strong><em>Will GDPR Halt Machine Learning in its Tracks?</em></strong></a></p>
<p>One of the core tenets of GDPR is the transparency of the process (snuggle up with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/">Article 12</a> for more information). But what about advancements that are inherently obfuscated? Is machine learning doomed? That's not the case, according to Software Testing News. GDPR isn't dangerous for machine learning. According to Can Huzmeli, GDPR Delivery Manager at ICAN Consultancy: “As long as the way you do your data processing is secure in terms of privacy, you can use any algorithm. […]If you also do not illegally share the output of your algorithm, then you are safe.”</p>

<p>Small businesses are overwhelmed. IT professionals, despite being in the know, feel they (collectively) are not ready for today. UK marketers are ready to open their wallets. But, <em>two out of three people now feel more comfortable sharing their personal data, thanks to the new regulations.</em> These micro-stories and others, in <a href="https://www.econsultancy.com/blog/70031-the-best-gdpr-stats-surveys-we-ve-seen" title="Econsultancy's GDPR Stats and Surveys roundup">Econsultancy's GDPR Stats and Surveys roundup</a>.</p>

<p>It's May 25, and you're GDPR-ready. But have you written and communicated out your privacy policy? No doubt you (or your inbox) has seen the deluge of 'We're updating our terms of service” messages. Onslaught aside - it's no joke. GDPR ushers in a raft of new procedures. But it's worthwhile to separate out the difference between policy and procedure.  It's spelled out for you <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/what__privacy_policy_has_4_ss_in_it_/">here in part six of this six-part series</a>.

<p>Businesses today face increasing levels of complexity and risk. Simultaneously, the pressure to maintain safe working environments, remain highly competitive and meet customer demands are increasing.</p>
<p>As complexity grows, so does risk sophistication. Our brochure discusses how the adoption of Standards is more than a checkbox activity to please regulators, but provides a sound approach to building a progressive risk-based-thinking culture.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Regulators hope that compliance programs will focus on more than just traditional training and improve their year-round communications.</strong></p>
<p><em>“I think one of the most significant issues is the ongoing and continuing reminders. Often, companies will put into place a compliance program, maybe people get trained on the first day of the job, maybe they sign a piece of paper or a training program, but what kind of follow up is there? Companies have constant turnover. People are coming and going. It requires a regular update...making it not just a onetime event, but a continuing responsibility of folks in your organization.”</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>The cost of compliance is money well-spent. The cost of non-compliance is an expensive missed opportunity.</strong></p>
<p><em>“When a company creates and fosters a culture of compliance, it creates value. Compliance is an investment. Ethical, law-abiding companies can better attract investors and partners. People want to do business with companies that they perceive as honest and reliable. Compliance mitigates risk, making companies more valuable and less likely to encounter unanticipated costs that may result from protracted investigations and penalties.”</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Compliance must be operationalized and integrated into your business goals, decisions, and organizational culture.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Compliance should not be treated as separate and distinct from other business goals. A culture of compliance must be fully integrated into corporate culture. Employees should be trained and encouraged to think about compliance issues in making business decisions.”</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>The compliance and risk functions within an organization should work together and help each other to truly succeed.</strong></p>
<p><em>“A company that properly manages its risks through a robust and appropriate compliance function - one that grows along with the rest of the company - will remain ahead of the curve. Our Department does not use a rigid formula to assess the effectiveness of corporate compliance. Each company's risk profile and solutions to reduce its risks warrant consideration. We make an individualized determination in each case.”</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Compliance officers should be prepared to answer two fundamental questions if they ever come under investigation, and have data to support their answers.</strong></p>
<p><em>"First, what was the state of the compliance program at the time of the improper conduct? Second, what is the current state of the compliance function, after remediation to address any lessons learned?"</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>There are four significant factors the DOJ will weigh when they conclude an investigation and evaluate what penalty or punishment to impost on a corporation:</strong></p>
<p><em>1) </em> How egregious was the nature of the conduct and violation?</p>
<p><em>2) </em> Did the company voluntarily disclose the violation?</p>
<p><em>3) </em> Did the company take appropriate remedial action?</p>
<p><em>4) </em> Did the company cooperate with the DOJ to help identify the wrongdoers?</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>If a company expects to be treated like a victim in the wake of employee wrongdoing, they're expected to act like a victim, too.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Somebody who is a victim of a crime is going to be eager to assist the government in catching the perpetrator, and so, the company that comes in early and discloses misconduct, that cooperates with us in pursuing individual violators, and then takes remedial action to ensure it won't happen again is going to get the most consideration when we determine whether or not to pursue charges and what sort of financial penalty to exact.”</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Compliance is a living, breathing component of your culture that needs constant attention and evolution.</strong></p>
<p><em>“People ought to understand that these policies are not just written there in order to satisfy some bureaucratic requirement but it's actually a reflection of corporate culture. When you go into companies that operate that way, you see that; you see the messaging from corporate CEOs, people hear about it in their interviews, they learn about it in their orientation programs, they see the company take appropriate action when there are violations. So that's what the department is looking for; it's really whether or not there is a compliance program that was designed with the companies risk profile in mind, that evolves to fit new challenges, and is actually implemented in a way that all employees of the corporation understand it.” </em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Compliance Takes a Front Seat</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So what does all of this mean for you? Much of what Rosenstein said is likely aligned with how you feel about the role your ethics and compliance team plays within your organization. Comments like these are valuable tools when you're making the case for more resources, a new hire, or a seat at the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>If your colleagues believe that ethical behavior and a compliant culture can't be a differentiator or benefit to your bottom line, the Department of Justice feels it can.</li><li>If your C-suite thinks compliance shouldn't collaborate across functions and be in the board room for strategic meetings, the Department of Justice thinks you should.</li><li>If you've unsuccessfully been trying to justify additional investment in your E&amp;C program to improve it every year and do more than just annual training, the Department of Justice thinks that should change.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One thing is certain: the expectations that regulators and employees have for ethics and compliance programs are evolving. The effectiveness of your program and culture of your organization are dependent upon your ability to adapt. </strong></p>

Learn the how-tos.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">Gamification is the technique of applying the science and psychology of gaming to non-game experiences - like ethics and compliance learning.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/iPhone_badges-800px.jpg" /></div><p>Ethics and compliance is inherently a very serious concern for organizations, with severe consequences if incidents occur. As part of their compliance programs, many organizations complement traditional training with awareness communications, but the nature of the content can influence how the message is delivered and consumed - and not always in a good way. As a result, <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_learning/" title="ethics and compliance learning">ethics and compliance learning</a> can often lack creativity and, to the learners who have to complete it, feel dry, distant, and repetitive. </p>
<p>As compliance officers aspire to make their programs more effective, learning experience designers like me relish the challenge of creating thought-provoking, relevant, and engaging experiences that genuinely build awareness, and the motivation and skills to actively minimize risk. To succeed, we're always looking beyond the world of learning for new approaches to designing effective ethics and compliance content. Recently, many people have been getting excited about one approach in particular - 'gamification.'  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A game on two wheels</strong></h3>
<p>Let me share an example. As an avid cyclist, I spend much of the summer dressed in Lycra, huffing and puffing my way up and whizzing down hills, all in the pursuit of a basic level of fitness. But despite my love for it, I sometimes found it quite tough to motivate myself to get out on the bike. It was so easy to find excuses: “I'm too busy,” or “I'm too tired,” or “I live in the UK and it's too wet and windy.” To my trainer's dismay, I often simply convinced myself that I didn't need to ride that day.</p>
<p>But then I discovered a brilliant cycling tracker app for my iPhone that helps me see how all my efforts are worthwhile. I can track how far I've cycled, how many calories I've burned, how fast I've gone, and then compare it all to my previous rides. When I get home from a ride, I post it all on social media and bask in the glow of my achievements. As I continue riding, I set new goals for myself. My first 50 mile ride? Check. 1000 miles in a year? Check. First 100 mile ride? Ask me in a few months.</p>
<p>This cycling tracker app is a great example of 'gamification' - the technique of applying the science and psychology of gaming to non-game experiences.  The points, badges, goals, and the social and competitive elements in the app, all motivate me to engage, encourage me to progress, challenge me to improve and drive me to compete. For me, this makes me cycle more, cycle better, and help me achieve my objective of keeping fit and healthy.</p>

<p>  </p>
<h3><strong>Life's a game</strong></h3>
<p>Gamification is everywhere. From the supermarket and coffee shop loyalty programs that award us points and special discounts the more we buy, to the dieting programs that reward us with badges for sensible food eaten and weight lost. There are even gamified running apps that simulate a swarm of zombies chasing us for extra motivation on our daily jogs.  </p>
<p><strong>My issue on the bike was that I couldn't tell if my cycling was doing me any good, yet I was certainly feeling the pain.</strong> However, the features and design of the cycling tracker app, and especially its use of gamification elements, enabled me to continually see the value I was driving from my efforts, which motivated me to increase my activity.  </p>
<p>As the benefits that compliance officers desire from their compliance programs grow more ambitious, it becomes even more essential to innovate in the design of <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_learning/" title="ethics and compliance learning">ethics and compliance learning</a> solutions. Similarly, learners who have become fatigued by their experiences with ethics and compliance training year on year are also demanding innovation, and expect digital learning to reflect their experiences in the broader digital world.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Information%20Security%20“Blindspot”%20Gamified%20Pre-Training%20Experience%20with%20SAI%20Global_800px_wide.png?n=2883" /></div><p><em>Information Security “Blindspot” Gamified Pre-Training Experience with SAI Global</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Designing learning experiences that drive outcomes</strong> </h3>
<p>The 'gamification' aspect of my cycle tracker app works so well because it reinforces the ultimate purpose of the app, to motivate. The overarching purpose of learning is to deliver change. We design our <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_learning/" title="ethics and compliance learning">ethics and compliance learning</a> solutions to change people from potentially presenting a risk, into people able to 'do the right thing', by doing their jobs ethically and in compliance with company policies and the law.</p>
<p>When people don't do the right thing, it's usually because:</p>
<ul><li>They don't know what the right thing to do is because they lack the knowledge of the risks to which they and the business are exposed.</li><li>They don't believe in the need to do the right thing because their personal attitude to risk is not aligned with that of the business.</li><li>They don't know how to do the right thing because they lack the skills to prevent, recognize, and respond to risk.</li><li>They don't apply their knowledge, attitude and skills because they fail to display the appropriate behaviors to prevent and mitigate risk.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When we clearly define the change <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_compliance/" title="our ethics and compliance learning solutions">our ethics and compliance learning solutions</a> need to deliver, we can design learning experiences to achieve that change. So our challenge is to adopt the most effective instructional methodologies, approaches, and tools to help people do the right thing. Gamification is just one of many powerful tools in our learning design toolbox that we can use to help us succeed. </p>
<p><br />
In future posts, I'll dive deeper into how gaming and gamification can make learning more effective. I'll also explore trends in the value of a campaign-based approach, measuring effectiveness, adaptive learning and much more.</p>
<p>As to how I do on that 100-mile cycle ride - I'll let you know.<br /><br /></p>

Are ethical frameworks next?</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/2018-06-10_10-38-11.jpg" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"><em><sup>image source: screen capture from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUQ-DdSDoE&amp;t=1s (Google I/O demo)</sup></em></p>
<p>It's a challenge today to have a conversation about technology without invoking big data, machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI). The pace is incredibly fast, and the applications broad, beyond those typically associated with mathematics. I think the future - and true value of AI - is the advancement of computers assuming roles once thought only for humans.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We </strong></em><strong>can </strong><em><strong>teach a computer right from wrong, but we'd better do it quickly.</strong></em></p>
<p>We're at the stage now where we've moved from, 'there's no way a computer could do that' to, 'well, if someone has the idea, they just need to execute it.' Computers (including algorithms, ML, and AI) now permit us to move from idea to hypothesis much quicker. That leads to a faster time to finding the prototype (of whatever it is) that works, all while processing incredible amounts of readily accessible data. The next big advancement will be to move from a huge silo of data to create <em>farms</em> of interconnected data. Before we talk about computers designing ethical frameworks, it's helpful to briefly review some recent advancements in AI.</p>
<h3>From 0s and 1s to 'To Be's and 'Not To Be's</h3>
<p>It's clear that machine learning and artificial intelligence can aid in scaling repeatable tasks steeped in mathematics. After all, that's the core of what computers and programs are: binary decisions, off or on, zero or one. Machine learning's strength and weakness is that it's only as good as what goes into it (more conversationally known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">'garbage in, garbage out.'</a>). We've advanced beyond that, for the most part.</p>
<p>If a computer evolves its learning and thinking from a corpus of very good work, then a better end-result is more likely. This goes beyond sophisticated mathematics. In March 2016, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/japanese-ai-writes-novel-passes-first-round-nationanl-literary-prize/">a Japanese AI program wrote a short novel, and it almost won a literary prize</a>. Key to that near-award? “Hitoshi Matsubara and his team at Future University Hakodate in Japan selected words and sentences, and set parameters for construction before letting the AI 'write' the novel autonomously.” Humans selected the prose from which the code was to model.</p>
<h3>A Computer Becoming a True Virtual Assistant</h3>
<p>On May 8, TechInsider posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUQ-DdSDoE&amp;t=1s">short video from Google's annual I/O conference.</a> One of the many things revealed there was Google Duplex, an update coming to Google Home and Assistant. Duplex can use natural language processing (NLP) to make phone calls for you and talk to the person on the other end to schedule appointments and make reservations.</p>
<p>This is the proof of concept. This is code learning, in real-time, responses based on a real-time interaction with a human. With sophisticated AI, even more is capable. Instead of booking a hair salon appointment, imagine asking Siri, Alexa, Cortana or GoogleHome to “renew my driver's license.” The nuances of NLP, the variations from US state to US state to enable that request … the list is endless. We've seen that a virtual assistant can respond to a few queries and still book an appointment. We're not far off from AI helping us efficiently deliver government services, like renewing a driver's license by voice, or applying for a building permit for a home renovation project. These are becoming reality today as government works to become more personal through the use of these technologies.  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Is Computer Intelligence Artificial?</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Teaching a (Robot) Dog New Tricks</h3>
<p>Reading, writing, 'rithmetic: check. On deck: teaching a computer morality. According to Dr. Vyacheslav Polonski <a href="https://medium.com/@drpolonski/can-we-teach-morality-to-machines-three-perspectives-on-ethics-for-artificial-intelligence-64fe479e25d3">here</a>, “Before giving machines a sense of morality, humans have to first define morality in a way computers can process. A difficult but not impossible task."</p>
<p>Imagine our state of mind if we could create an app that only fed us 'good news.' While excellent at reducing our stress levels, surely we'd be missing out a lot. There's immense subjectivity in who decides what a 'good' story is. Our own definition of 'good' is inherently factored into that, whether we like it (or know it) or not.</p>
<blockquote><p>A machine cannot be taught what is fair unless the engineers designing the AI system have a precise conception of what fairness is.</p><p>Dr. Vyacheslav Polonski</p></blockquote><p>The reality is that we already have. When the Facebook 'wall' went away and Zuckerberg + co. introduced the concept of a newsfeed, it would have been overwhelming to show a Facebook member the unfiltered view of posts, like, ads, games, and so on. So an algorithm was created to only show the most important items to a particular Facebook member. But what was deemed 'important'? And, by whom? Over time, the outrage grew. Add in the cries of 'fake news,' citing examples where stories were told but from (subjectively) less-than-truthful sources. In the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-snapchat-and-the-dawn-of-the-post-truth-era/amp?__twitter_impression=true">age of rapid sharing and expiring online content</a>, it's difficult to know what is real and what is fake. And it starts to raise doubts about who (or what) that arbiter is.</p>
<p>Soon, we could use AI to identify what the truth is of any given number of stories. Part of that task becomes identifying not just a corpus of work, but instead identifying a good corpus of work. And in the age of news, 'good' becomes 'truthful,' 'trustworthy,' or 'correct.' That arbiter of good plays a primary function here. In 11 or so years, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/robots-will-be-smarter-than-us-all-by-2029-warns-ai-expert-ray-kurzweil-9147506.html">intelligent machines will be able to outsmart human beings</a>, according to futurist Ray Kurzweil. We will need to have firmly established what an unbiased corpus of work looks like for that training, and be able to put trust in the trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>We need to be able to put trust in the trust.</strong></em></p>
<h3>'<a href="https://xkcd.com/149/">Sudo</a>, Make me a Privacy Policy'</h3>
<p>Yes, we can teach a computer morality, but we'd better do it quickly. If we can teach a computer to write near-award-winning prose, and we can teach a computer morality, then it should be able to write us a code of ethics. Soon, but not tomorrow. Here's something more tangible, though:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Envision that we need to update our privacy policy in the wake of May 25, 2018 and the go-live date of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (aka <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/a_risk-based_approach_to_gdpr__it_s_as_easy_as_a__b__c/" title="GDPR">GDPR</a>). We could write it on our own or we could ask a computer to do so, drawing from several other good ones. What we're looking for is that prototype, because the likelihood of the AI to produce us a new GDPR privacy policy with which we are 100% comfortable is very slim.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Instead, it can give us a very good first draft, building on the experience of others. In turn, it would let us, as humans, audit and edit the work of these rapid prototypes to then create a final product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or imagine this scenario:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Countless cyber attacks happen everyday on organizations big and small. Some of the attacks are the same or slight variations of one another. This data could be collected and analyzed for things like origin, company size, threat vector, and so on, to then have an AI make pre-emptive recommendations to others, warning against the likelihood of such an attack. Humans can't do this at scale. But an AI-assisted tool can help humans think ahead, helping reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats on organizations and on individuals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or, this scenario:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">An investor wishes to make smarter choices about where to place her money. But reviewing the vast amounts of data in any meaningful amount of time would let her make very few tweaks to her investment strategy. Instead, she can leverage AI to review the publicly-transcribed earnings calls and reports to spot word clusters, trends, avoidances, and so on. The AI leverages NLP and turns a former human-focused task into a cogent output, complete with a recommendation based on a corpus of fed text. Now she can make a wiser, less risk-averse investment decision, based on a much greater consumption of relevant data.</p>
<p>And the great thing with this scenario: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2017/12/04/predicting-stock-performance-deep-learning/">it's real</a>.</p>
<p>The end game here isn't for AI to solely create a GDPR privacy policy, or to alert my organization of the next Cloudbleed, or to tell me where to invest. We can't have the algorithm or model sitting in a locked black box. We need to be able to trust the AI with assistance, not sole execution. We must always maintain some level of human oversight to ensure that we know we're avoiding a potential garbage in, garbage out model. One model where we as humans define what garbage is and isn't; what good is and isn't, and using the AI to get us there faster.</p>
<h3>AI as a Faster Way to MVP</h3>
<p>We can use AI as an accelerant to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" title="minimum viable product">minimum viable product</a>. We can more quickly create a prototype, then edit it to suit our needs. But it's merely a faster way, not the only way. Humans simply cannot be eliminated from this equation. There will be a need for humans as knowledge workers. Even in something like automotive manufacturing, there's still some level of human involvement or oversight required. There needs to be a confirmation to humans, by a human, to validate that something is safe and trustworthy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AI is here to save the day, but it is not a panacea and we can't put it in a black box. It is powerful and has helped humans accomplish much, and we've only scratched the surface. However, we need to be mindful of asking, 'For what value? For what reason?' We need to avoid 'just because,' as we'll be faced with a precarious situation if we don't.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 11.1111px;"></span><em><sup>image source: https://ilac.org/news-and-events/world-accreditation-day/</sup></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For 10 years now the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and ILAC, the international organization for accreditation bodies, have come together to raise awareness of the importance of accreditation through their joint global initiative, the World Accreditation Day (WAD). We're proud supporters of these organizations and the initiative. Accreditation is valuable for many reasons, one of which is safety.</p>
<p> <br />
This year, the WAD focuses on how accreditation delivers a safer world. Accreditation plays a vital role in keeping people safe in their domestic life, their work life, ... well, in almost all aspects of their lives. In today's free-market societies we have an expectation and a right to the availability of safe products or services; whether we're buying our weekly groceries, using the washing machine, a cell phone, driving a car, eating in a restaurant, or simply walking across a bridge. As you can imagine, there are accreditation schemes and requirements for all kinds of things. To put it simply, accreditation aims to create a consistent way for the testing, inspection and certification sector to make things better by ensuring products and services are safer, of a higher quality, and easier to use. <br />
 <br />
It also plays a pivotal role for businesses, both large and small, and for their employees.<br />
 <br />
If a business can demonstrate compliance with best practice by implementing a health &amp; safety management system it can seriously improve reputation and increase opportunities to gain new business. It can minimize risks of downtime through accidents, demonstrate commitment with legal obligations, achieve potential cost savings from public liability insurance premiums and attract and retain staff. Plus, accredited certification provides market differentiation and objective proof that products are safe and meet specification.<br />
 <br />
In essence accredited certification helps all kinds of organizations to work in a better and smarter way, by not only assessing and controlling risks of the internal operation of companies, but also the products and services that they place on the market. This improves their efficiency and aids with innovation - and ultimately benefits us in our everyday life and our work life. <br /><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><br />
According to estimates from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), 152 million children are currently victims of forced labor. The need for corporations to get serious about rooting out such unethical, exploitive, and criminal activity from their supply chains has never been greater. And not just because governments across the globe are stamping down hard on companies that miss or ignore the signs of such activity. It is a corporate imperative from an humanitarian perspective. <br /><br />
Speaking about modern slavery at the Clinton Global Initiative conference in September 2012, Former U.S. President Barack Obama said: “It ought to concern every person because it is a debasement of our common humanity. It ought to concern every community because it tears at our social fabric. It ought to concern every business because it distorts markets. It ought to concern every nation because it endangers public health and fuels violence and organized crime.”<br /><br />
Strong words by Obama and rightfully so. It is a 'debasement of our common humanity' and corporations with significant presence in the world's most developed economies, whether knowingly or not, rely on people working in slavery to produce the goods they sell, or have supply chains that can encourage traffickers. <br /><br />
In an increasingly connected world, criminals are operating under the radar and making sickening profits. According to an ILO report, <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/publications/ilo-bookstore/order-online/books/WCMS_243391/lang--en/index.htm" title="Profits and Poverty: The Economics of Forced Labour"><em>Profits and Poverty: The Economics of Forced Labour</em></a>, slave labor is an estimated $150 billion business more often that not managed by networks of third parties and shell corporations that are backed by organized crime, drug cartels, and terrorist organizations. <br /><br />
Globally there are over 1.5 billion people living in countries that are affected by conflict, and some 200 million people affected by natural disasters every year. When people are forced to flee their homes, or can't continue their farming or work because of natural disasters, families, and their children, are plunged further into poverty and are forced into a situation that in order to survive they have to work, no matter how difficult, dangerous, or badly paid.<br /><br />
This is where the exploitative nature of these criminal organizations profit from the subjugation of those most in need. The spotlight then falls on corporate leaders to identify the red flags that are the signals of modern child slavery and proactively do more to combat and eradicate exploitation and forced labor in their supply chains.<br /><br />
But what is actually being done across the world stage to tackle this issue and make corporations accountable? The enforcement of anti-money laundering, anti-slavery, and anti-bribery laws that can be used to penalize corporations in the global supply chain is a step in the right direction to eradicate such activity. However, the complexity of this issue lies with how multinational companies can expose, combat, and police third-party contractors and vendors that could be, or are, exploiting children for their own means. Technology can play a pivotal role in helping organizations tackle such complexities and work towards the eradication of modern slavery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<blockquote><p>The spotlight falls on corporate leaders to identify the red flags that are the signals of modern slavery and proactively do more to combat and eradicate exploitation and forced labor in their supply chains.</p></blockquote><h3>How technology is helping fight back</h3>
<p>A clear business case exists for embedding an ethical approach in an organization's operations with its suppliers, as well as an overwhelming case from the standpoint of safeguarding human rights. The methods for achieving this outcome require commitment and due diligence but they are well within the scope of any modern organization to achieve.</p>
<p>This is where technology can help organizations tackle the issue of child slave labor. Increasingly organizations are becoming more aware of, and more engaged with, the issues of forced child labor and human rights in supply chains and are turning towards compliance risk management solutions to improve their business conduct and remove the conditions that allow such exploitations to flourish.</p>
<p>Ethics learning also has a part to play because today's multinational organizations need a behavior model for their employees to recognize the red flags and identify the types of irregularities and patterns of crime associated with modern slavery. </p>
<p>With a clear mandate to expose unethical behavior, and empowered with the right technology, organizations can help instil awareness of human rights issues that can arise within their industry, and within their supply chains. Despite organizations having vast resources that can be leveraged in the fight against modern slavery, the issue is still rife and the need for corporations to get serious about rooting criminal activity out of their supply chains has never been greater. </p>
<p>We have a responsibility to make sure that our workers are not being exploited, that they are safe and that relevant employment (including wage and work hour), health &amp; safety and human rights laws and international standards are adhered to.</p>
<p>To abolish modern slavery in all forms, be that child or adult, businesses, corporate leaders, and consumers must actively be part of the solution.</p>

<p>PwC's recently released their <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/risk-assurance/library/state-of-compliance-study.html"><em>2018 State of Compliance Study</em></a>, an annual report they publish based on survey results from the ethics and compliance community. This year's PwC State of Compliance Study shares the results of 825 surveyed global risk and compliance executives to see: </p>
<ul><li>how satisfied they are with the effectiveness of their current E&amp;C programs;</li><li>what makes them effective; and</li><li>how changes to the regulatory and business climate around the world are forcing them to evolve.</li></ul>
<p>In a previous piece of research conducted by PwC (their annual CEO Survey), it was discovered that executives consider over-regulation one of the top threats to the growth of their company, and that the maturity and growth of global regulatory agencies have led to a need for more sophistication in their compliance programs. As the findings of their State of Compliance Study reveals, that sophistication has come in the form of improvements to two pillars of their ethics and compliance programs: the technology they use and the data they collect. </p>
<p>The report itself is built on the foundation of one important question and trends that were identified as a result of the answer: “Please rate your level of satisfaction with the effectiveness of your compliance program.” Of the 825 executives asked, only 17% (140 executives) are very satisfied with the effectiveness of their compliance programs. The report uses that 17%, identified as 'leaders', to help identify what this group does differently than the rest. The differentiators between 'leaders' and their peers were broken down into four main factors that contribute to their compliance program's success and effectiveness. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>Leaders invest in technology to improve their approach to data and support the infrastructure of their compliance program.</em></strong></h3>
<p>When asked what technologies could be leveraged more often by the compliance function to succeed and improve effectiveness, leaders said that analytics tools, dashboards, and the monitoring of policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Despite this, a look at data collected from all survey respondents revealed that </p>
<ul><li>50% currently use technology to monitor employee compliance with E&amp;C related policies and procedures;</li><li>44% currently use policy management technology as part of their compliance program; and</li><li>37% say one of their top challenges is an insufficient budget to invest in technology.</li></ul>
<p>More than a third state that more budget would permit more (and presumably better) investments in technology. The reality is that their more successful peers are in their positions <em>because of</em> technology investments. Savvy survey respondents can leverage this data point to successfully argue for an increased technology budget to propel their organizations forward, like the leaders here. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>Leaders use analytics and technology to increase compliance-monitoring effectiveness.</em></strong> </h3>
<p>According to the report: </p>
<ul><li>66% of leading compliance programs use technology to monitor employee compliance with policies and procedures - especially in relation to cybersecurity, fraud, data privacy, social media, and gifts and entertainment.<br /><br /></li><li>Almost three-quarters (76%) of leaders use “moderately or very sophisticated technology to monitor employee compliance” in relation to cybersecurity, a full 24% more than the second ranked risk topic, fraud, and 42% above the bottom ranked risk topic, conflicts of interest. </li></ul>
<p>Technology also enables leaders with better insights and root cause analyses, as well as the ability to respond to risk-related threats and identified behavioral outliers in real time.</p>
<h3><br /><strong><em>Leaders streamline policy management to increase responsiveness and policy effectiveness.</em></strong></h3>
<p>Leaders in this category are more likely to keep their code, policies, and procedures current and easily accessible, and streamline these processes with GRC technology tools. In fact, <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/compliance_and_risk/compliance_360/apps/policy_management_grc_software/">67% of leaders have one source for all of their policy management</a>. The streamlined approach also make it easier to measure the effectiveness of these policies and procedures. </p>
<p>When it comes to Codes of Conduct, 43% of leaders review their Code of Conduct annually and 38% review on an as-needed basis. Compared to all survey respondents, only 30% review their code annually - a significant difference and one of the facets that sets apart the leaders from the rest of the pack. If you're interested in learning more about Code of Conduct best practices, or how to effectively review and rewrite a Code when that time comes, we recently hosted a webinar on that topic, <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP541?id=0">and you can view a recording of it here</a>. </p>
<p>When it comes to measuring the overall effectiveness of E&amp;C policies and procedures, PwC's 2018 research revealed the most and least commonly used methods, as illustrated in the image included with this post.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>Leaders use data and technology to provide targeted, engaging, and up-to-date compliance training</em></strong>.</h3>
<p>How do leaders differentiate themselves from the rest of the E&amp;C community when it comes to the actual training they provide? </p>
<ul><li>First and foremost, they use multiple sources of data, and technology, to <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_compliance/info_security_and_cybersecurity/">target their training to specific employees</a>.<br /><br /></li><li>Second, they cover more risk topics than their peers as part of their overall approach to training and communications, and <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/case_studies/2018/teva_pharmaceutical_s_transformation_to_a_campaign-based_ethics_and_compliance_program/">67% will update their training and communications on an annual basis</a>, compared to 49% of the entire survey group.<br /><br /></li><li>Third, leaders also use a <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/case_studies/2017/johnson_controls_international_builds_award_winning_ethics_compliance_program/">variety of different training methods</a> to engage their audience, and use data from monitoring activities to inform decisions around their program. Last, this group of effective E&amp;C executives plan to increase their use of “frequent, short-form, anytime, anywhere, any device communications.”</li></ul>
<p>These differentiation tactics are extremely valuable from the perspective of how employees perceive ethics and compliance training and engage with it. Neglecting to update training and communications on an annual basis, with new information or new formats, can actually undermine your efforts and effectiveness in the long run. Ask yourself this question; how seriously will my employees take our training on bribery and corruption if we don't take the time and effort to actually update the content we send them from one year to the next?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire group of participants, 53% expect to increase how often they conduct traditional online training (30+ minutes) in the next three years, while 52% expect to do more frequent, short-form communications in the next three years.</p>
<p>When it comes to what they'll be focusing on, these are the top seven topics cited from the survey results: </p>
<ul><li>Data privacy</li><li>Cybersecurity</li><li>Mutual respect and harassment</li><li>Conflicts of interest</li><li>Gifts and entertainment</li><li>Fraud</li><li>Bribery and corruption</li></ul>
<p>   </p>
<p>PwC's 2018 State of Compliance Report is full of insights valuable to our community. What we found most interesting is data to support two ideas we believe with conviction. First, the definition of program effectiveness is constantly evolving. Second, equipping your organization with technology and data that can operate across your entire risk and compliance program is critical to keep up in today's business landscape.

Access the webinar recording now.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"></p><p>It's no surprise our webinar, 'Insolvency Law Reform - The Essentials' had the highest attendance rates in the past year. It shows how relevant this topic is to those who practice in this demanding industry.   </p>
<p>Our webinar highlighted a little known fact - that insolvency law reform is an initiative under the Government's 'National Innovation and Science Agenda.' Among other things, such initiatives are aimed at aligning business laws with a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation.  </p>
<p>Two tranches of reform were implemented in March and September 2017 by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016A00011"><em>Insolvency Law Reform Act 2016</em></a>. Tranche One was about the registration and discipline of practitioners, and tranche two was about the insolvency administration process.</p>
<p>While few webinar attendees believe Australia's insolvency profession is not over-regulated, the remainder were divided equally between 'yes, it is over-regulated' or are 'undecided.' It seems that there is no shortage of academics and commentators saying Australia is bucking the global trend led by jurisdictions such as the EU, the US, and Asia. In the spotlight is the trend to focus on improving insolvency regulation to promote efficiency and support restructuring, instead of focusing on regulating practitioners. Perhaps the reform introduced by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017A00112"><em>Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No 2) Act 2017</em></a> (that amends the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00131"><em>Corporations Act 2001</em></a>) would receive a better welcome.</p>
<p>During the webinar, we also looked at the new 'safe harbor' provisions which provide an exception to the prohibition on insolvent trading by directors (already commenced). In addition, we looked at a new stay on enforcement of 'ipso facto' clauses that previously allowed a party to terminate a contract when an insolvency event arose (due to commence in July 2018). The latter generated interest, as well as questions. </p>
<p>Some experts queried how the ipso facto reform would impact parties exercising step-in rights or making set-off claims on banks calling on bank guarantees, if the action is triggered by an insolvency event. Such an action could be contrary to the reform, so it could be subject to the stay. As the reform only applies to contracts entered into post 1 July 2018, we will not see how the legislation works in real life for some time.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this reform will impact insolvency practitioners. Luckily, innovation and science provide tools that give the profession a hand in running their practice. For example, when tackling a matter in restructuring, the ability to see the full picture fast is most valuable. No one can give us a crystal ball, but a tool that creates an interactive commercial picture, and helps build a crystal-clear understanding of the relationships between people, companies, property, assets and debt, is something all practitioners can utilise. Rest assured: we can navigate the increasingly regulated environment and the vast amounts of information with greater ease, and at the same time minimise the risk of overlooking something important.

<p><strong>Residual Current Devices (RCDs)</strong></p>
<p>All final sub-circuits in a residential installation, no matter the amperage or number of phases, are to be 30mA RCD protected. In general, the changes made now require fixed or stationary electrical equipment, such as a hot water service, cooktop, oven or range to be protected by a 30mA RCD.</p>
<p>In non-residential installations, all final sub-circuits, up to and including 32A, multi-phase and lighting, are to be 30mA RCD protected. There are however two scenarios to this requirement so it is especially important to read and understand the new requirements.</p>
<p>There are several exceptions to the non-residential installations that exist already but a new one has been added. If the owner/operator deems that a piece of electrical equipment must not be exposed to nuisance tripping, as it may cause economic or personnel disruption for example, then the RCD can be left off the final sub-circuit. As with any of these exceptions it is required to have over-current protection at the switchboard, mechanical protection of the cable, wiring connection marked to state that RCD protection is not provided.</p>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicle Charging Systems</strong></p>
<p>Technical details as to electric vehicle charging and required installation practices have been added in the appendices. Whilst this is a recommendation, any person looking at design and construct should consider installation of these devices where required.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for all the changes covering Residual Current Devices (RCDs), Mains Wwitches, Kitchens, Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDDs), Switchboards, Electric Vehicle Charging Systems, Lifts, Safety Services, Alterations and Repairs, Water heaters, Conductors, Outbuildings and Recessed Lighting.</p>

Gary Michael Busbridge has been with Clipsal for over 40 years, after graduating from the University of South Australia in 1973. Predominantly, his responsibility was Design Manager for all Australian Electrical Accessories, including aspects of Data and C-Bus, Export and Industrial design, development, product maintenance and prototyping. Inevitably, this led to involvement with the Standards Association of Australia and membership of committees and working groups from 1998.
<br />
<br />

 His new role of Standardisation Manager is to ensure Global and Regional Standards are aligned to the electrical contracting business and electrical accessories manufacture. This also includes relevant IEC standards and applications. In November 2011 he was made Chairman of the EL001 Wiring Rules standards committee.

What’s new though is the availability of powerful business intelligence (BI) tools to identify and track predictive metrics and to transform that data into powerful insights to power more effective decision making and improve environmental, health and safety (EHS) management.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/123691_EHS_Business_Intelligence_Blog_header_640x340.png" /></div><p>Business Intelligence, or BI as we know it today, has a longer history than you might think; one that predates computers and other technological advances. In fact, the first term of 'business intelligence' appeared way back when in 1865 by Richard Millar Devens in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/cyclopaediacomm00devegoog" title="Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes in that year.">Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes in that year. </a><br /><br />
Devens used the term to talk about how a banker, Sir Henry Fumese, used “business intelligence” to gain a leg up on his competitors. Through careful study, he gained knowledge of the political issues, risks, and general market conditions of that time. And there you have the first recorded use of BI.<br /><br />
It wasn't until the 20th century with the emergence of computers that BI really started to gain recognition. The 50s, 60s, and 70s came and went and with them the development of various enterprise applications but when it came to accessing data from multiple sources, they were one-dimensional reports. The problem was that the underlying data in these reports was very siloed; there wasn't a single, consistent view of the data.<br /><br />
Fast forward a decade and hello, data warehouses! With the likes of Ralph Kimball (one of data warehousing's original architects) and Bill Inmon (considered by many to be the father of the data warehouse) data warehouses were born and with them came the opportunity to bring together disparate data sources and store them in one place. Over the next two decades the number of companies using BI exploded and vendor numbers mushroomed. More and more companies were starting to understand the true value of the BI currency, and how it could help them.<br /><br />
Today most large organizations use BI as a key instrument to identify, among other things, patterns in customer buying behavior, predicting future stock requirements and detecting fraud. To do this, they have collected large volumes of transactional data and have applied sophisticated statistical algorithms to find patterns. All of this made possible due to process automation making more data available and the continual decrease in the cost of computing power. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Your Employees' Safety, in 1s and 0s<br /><br /></strong>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/compliance_and_risk/environment_health_and_safety_software_ehs/" title="EHS">EHS</a> realm, with its large amounts of data stored across organizations surely there is a need for “health &amp; safety data warehouses.” Buried in these warehouses are patterns, awaiting discovery and analysis that could assist with decision making when trying to determine where future incidents could occur.<br /><br />
EHS professionals are looking for ways to predict and prevent significant incidents. Traditionally, using statistical methods on historical data to determine what happened and why gives them a good indication of past performance, such as how many incidents of each type have occurred. This allows them to establish what has caused them. Using this information, an organization can learn from previous events and put controls in place to eliminate or reduce hazards and mitigate risks. <br /><br />
So EHS and BI are the perfect bedfellows!?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Moving Towards Operational Excellence</strong></p>
<p>EHS is a highly-regulated realm. Organizations need to measure and record significant amounts of data to ensure, and prove their, compliance to governing authorities , such as incidents, near misses, absence due to health &amp; safety accidents, safe behaviour observation, inspections, and root cause analysis investigations, just to name a few. <br /><br />
Traditionally, this information has been stored for compliance reasons and mainly used in isolation to tactically improve business operations. However, by using BI techniques, it is possible to significantly reduce EHS incidents and help organizations move towards operational excellence. Ultimately bringing greater value to the organization over and above just meeting compliance requirements.<br /><br />
When it comes to more mature organizations, they will use predictive analytics whereby they will apply rules to their historical EHS data. This can then be combined with external data to predict incidents that may happen in the future along with probabilities. When implemented properly with employees being able and willing to report near misses and incidents, this is a good method of predicting certain types of incident.<br /><br />
However, to actually prevent the incidents from happening, EHS professionals have to digest the results of the predictive analysis and determine the correct courses of action that need to be taken.<br /><br />
To fully benefit from BI predictions, EHS systems should ideally go one step further than just forecasting what could occur by suggesting actions that should be taken along with any associated consequences of each option given. This <strong>prescriptive analysis</strong> can help an organization make decisions around maximizing future opportunities or give the best chance of mitigating any risks with which they are faced.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>More Data, Fewer Incidents</strong></p>
<p>Advanced BI provides many potential benefits to EHS. One example is more reliable hazard detection processes: rather than relying solely on human expertise, advanced analytics and machine learning can be used to detect issues resulting in potential improvements in accuracy.<br /><br />
BI also gives organization a more reliable way of sharing best practices. If we look at best practices in risk detection as an example, they can be codified into computer algorithms and easily shared across multiple geographies and divisions. This results in greater consistency across the organization, as employees do not have to be relied on to share best practices anecdotally.<br /><br />
These all result in an increase in the detection of risks that will lead to a decrease in the number of serious incidents.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>The Road to a Safer Working Environment</strong></p>
<p>EHS BI should involve sifting the huge amount of EHS data that is collected by organizations, finding the relevant information, and turning it into prescriptive actions that will lead to a safer and more compliant working environment.<br /><br />
Having the ability to quickly turn raw data into actionable information can make the difference between smart EHS decisions and costly mistakes. But making sense of all the information from different data sources can be a challenge. That is why it is imperative to have the right BI tools in place to put data to work enabling easy identification of insights and the confidence to act, ensuring focus remains on performance improvement.</p>

<p>People are at the heart of any <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_learning/" title="ethics and compliance learning">ethics and compliance learning</a> experience. These people are trying to balance all their daily job responsibilities with longer-term initiatives, and usually juggling more demands on their time and attention than they may comfortably have. They are often multi-tasking and on the move. So, when you ask them to learn something-to spend some of their valuable time on ethics and compliance content-you need to make sure that getting to it and consuming it is as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>Your program is built around sharing key pieces of information about a risk an employee may encounter, a regulation or law that governs your industry, and a cultural value with which their behavior should align. Carefully considered learning design decisions and a variety of media formats help you bring this information to life. All of these choices are made to effectively tell a story that connects this information to an employee's role and responsibilities within your organization.</p>
<p>For years, the technology enabling the consumption of these experiences was a constant among a world of variables-the computer at their desk. It's no surprise that technology has changed and so has human behavior. As a result, we don't spend as much time on our computers or at our desks to accomplish our goals at work. These changes create opportunities for innovation, as well as a necessity to evolve and make our content more accessible. As we create new learning content for the ethics and compliance community, designing “mobile-first” experiences is always a priority.</p>
<p>But we also realize that we cannot neglect what we've already done, which is create, acquire, and assemble the largest collection of ethics and compliance learning content in the world. When presented with the choice of 'innovate' or 'ignore,' the decision was as easy as whether or not to accept a bribe. Our latest technology update is designed to address an unignorable technological and behavioral shift, and remove some of the barriers and burdens around content consumption your employees may have experienced in the past.</p>
<p>We've broadened the scope of our mobile enablement to include responsive design across <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP341 " title="our entire content library">our entire content library</a>, in all 59 supported languages, and upgraded the majority of our content library with enhanced accessibility functionality to be WCAG 2.0 AA level and US ADA 508 compliant.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xH_6qNN5vCM?rel=0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>Responsive design enables learners to access the same piece of content across any device, regardless of its screen size or orientation. This means they can move seamlessly between desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and portrait or landscape orientation, with content dynamically adjusting and re-orienting itself to best fit the available real estate. This device-agnostic approach also means that employees can start a learning experience on one device type, exit part-way through, and later use a different device to resume exactly where they left off. The dream of being able to deliver and consume ethics and compliance learning content anytime and anywhere is now one step closer to becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build learning experiences that can be consumed by anyone, with a diverse range of hearing, movement, and vision-related abilities, and in doing so, enable success for all the learners in your organization. To comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 AA Level accessibility standards</a> and U.S. American Disabilities Act (ADA) 508, our content now meets guidelines around four core web content accessibility principles and success criteria: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>
<p>These changes are important for many reasons, and specifically via the perspective of regulatory compliance, because for many E&amp;C professionals, that's the standard to which your programs are built.</p>
<p>The DOJ's 2017 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/page/file/937501/download"><em>Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs</em></a> provides guidance to ethics and compliance professionals on what questions they may be asked if under investigation for a regulatory failure. In it, they pose a very specific question about the effectiveness of training and communications: </p>
<p> </p>

<p>One year before this DOJ guidance was published, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/mobile-internet-use-passes-desktop-for-the-first-time-study-finds/">StatCounter, an internet monitoring firm</a>, reported that for the first time in history, internet traffic on mobile and tablet devices exceeded internet traffic on traditional desktop and laptop computers (51.2% vs. 48.7%). While it's natural to say this behavior and growing trend towards mobile-first is driven by the millennial generation, the reality is that everyone is embracing smartphones and modern innovations to technology. Data from the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/02/millennials-stand-out-for-their-technology-use-but-older-generations-also-embrace-digital-life/">Pew Research Center</a> supports that fact.</p>

<p>An important consideration is that of main switches. These are invaluable in protecting the installer when working on circuits within an installation. That ability to lock off is so important. To that end, a main switch must be manually operated in a single mechanical action using a knob, lever or push-button or the like. Electronic touch screens, programmable control systems or the like shall not be used as a means of operating main switches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Safety Services</strong></p>
<p>There has been a total restructure of Clause 7.2 Safety Services to help the reader in understanding the requirements of the section. For too long there has just been further detail added to the section in various clauses and it is up to the reader to find the necessary requirements of various types of installations.</p>
<p>To this end the restructure has separated each of the relevant types of installations with its own requirements without having to refer to other clauses within the section. Therefore, if you want to find out the requirements for “air-handling systems” or “main switches”, just head to the relevant clause and all of them are there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Alterations and repairs</strong></p>
<p>Where a whole switchboard is being upgraded to replace existing protection then that switchboard is to be brought up to date with RCD protection. A repair is a like-for-like replacement and as such does not require the installation of an RCD for that final sub-circuit. This extends to a replacement of an existing socket-outlet with a multi-socket-outlet, as it is deemed to be a point for maximum demand calculations no matter the number of socket-outlets on the one fixed wired device.</p>
<p>The replacement of halogen lights with LED lighting is also seen as a repair. An alteration however is a change to the existing final sub-circuit and as such requires a 30mA RCD at the switchboard (or a 30mA socket-outlet RCD at the start of an extended circuit).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for all the changes covering Kitchens, Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDDs), Switchboards, Lifts, Water heaters, Conductors, Outbuildings and Recessed Lighting.</p>

Gary Michael Busbridge has been with Clipsal for over 40 years, after graduating from the University of South Australia in 1973. Predominantly, his responsibility was Design Manager for all Australian Electrical Accessories, including aspects of Data and C-Bus, Export and Industrial design, development, product maintenance and prototyping. Inevitably, this led to involvement with the Standards Association of Australia and membership of committees and working groups from 1998.
<br />
<br />

 His new role of Standardisation Manager is to ensure Global and Regional Standards are aligned to the electrical contracting business and electrical accessories manufacture. This also includes relevant IEC standards and applications. In November 2011 he was made Chairman of the EL001 Wiring Rules standards committee.

<p>With stoves and cooktops, there is much confusion as to where the cooker switch and various socket-outlets and switches can be mounted. To this end, we have created a prohibited zone around and upwards of 150mm from each side of the cooktop to the ceiling or range-hood, whichever comes first or if there is nothing above, to a height of 2.5 metres. A new figure has been added to explain this in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDDs)</strong></p>
<p>Technical details as to a new technology called arc fault detection (failure of insulation on cord extension sets and leads which could lead to arcing and subsequent fire) using an Arc Fault Detection Device (AFDD) has been added in the appendices. Whilst this is a recommendation, any person looking at design and construct should consider installation of these devices where required.</p>
<p><strong>Switchboards</strong></p>
<p>There are important changes to requirements for switchboards. Exit and egress facilities have been considered carefully by the committee, as there have been quite a few deaths and injuries of recent times due to arc flash at switchboards. The space around switchboards, including entry and exit door sizes, the distance between open doors or racked-out equipment and distances from accessible faces to walls, has now been increased to enable easier exit in case of emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Lifts</strong></p>
<p>Lifts have always been seen as a Safety Service in the Wiring Rules and this is still a requirement for fire-rated switch-rooms and busways. There are many lifts that have been added to residential applications where the owner wants a means of conveyancing from one floor to another. We have added these “Normal” lifts to Section 4 for Electrical Equipment.</p>

<p>Mounting of isolating switches adjacent to split-system air-conditioners has been part of the standard for quite a while and now we are including water heaters, and heat pumps in that. Remember that the isolating switch should be mounted adjacent to and not on the unit to be isolated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Outbuildings</strong></p>
<p>There is one issue regarding outbuildings that has been confounding the committee and ultimately the contractor for too many years. To understand and clarify it has been necessary to provide detail as to Individual and Combined outbuildings.</p>
<p>If I can use these definitions to explain:</p>
<ul><li>Individual outbuilding<br />
 A single structure containing a switchboard that is separated by an area of land from the structure containing the switchboard that supplies it (was what we all knew as an Outbuilding).</li><li>Combined outbuilding<br />
 Two or more structures, sharing conductive reinforced foundations, conductive building frames or conductive roofing etc. and each containing a switchboard that is separated by an area of land from the structure containing the switchboard that supplies them.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be new figures added to provide detailed information on earthing and MEN requirements that should help even more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Recessed lighting</strong></p>
<p>Changes to recessed luminaires or downlights have occurred over the last year or so. These details from the recessed luminaire standard have been added into the Wiring Rules so that all facets of the industry have the same detail.</p>
<p>Now all downlights have a classification which can be easily understood by the wholesaler, the contractor, the specifier and the end-user and is marked on the product and on the packaging. The classifications range from the lowest rating of <em>“Do not Cover”</em> (no insulation around or above, not suitable for residential installation) to the highest rating of <em>“IC-4”</em> (insulation and combustible materials can abut and cover and does not allow air transfer from room to ceiling space or vice-versa).</p>

The outstanding feature of many of them is the complete <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1176" title="disconnect between organizations' espoused values">disconnect between organizations' espoused values</a> and their actual business practices.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are responsible for conducting the business affairs of the companies in accordance with all applicable laws and in a moral and honest manner… We want to be proud… and to know that [our company] enjoys a reputation for fairness and honesty and that it is respected.</p></blockquote><p>This quote comes from Enron's code of conduct at the time of the corporate scandal that kick-started the exponential growth in compliance programs worldwide.  Sadly, in the intervening years, it seems that little has changed. This excerpt from Oxfam's Code of Conduct at the time of the Haiti earthquake illustrates the point sharply:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Code of Conduct is … written to reflect the organisations’s fundamental beliefs and values … to support its mission to work with others to overcome poverty and suffering and its commitment to ensuring that staff members avoid using possible unequal power relationships for their own benefit.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Abandon all hope? </strong><br />
Codes of conduct are not necessarily doomed to failure.  However, to achieve impact and relevance we need to revisit our approach to writing, producing, and communicating them.  <br />
For too many organizations, a code of conduct is still just a tick in the compliance program box.  The 'lip service' code is fairly easy to spot:</p>
<ul><li>It's long, wordy, and excessively legalistic in tone.</li><li>It's bland in tone and visual design, reflecting little, if anything, of what makes the organization unique.</li><li>It's hard to find, often buried in the depths of the corporate intranet along with other lengthy and largely ignored policy documents.</li><li>It's rarely communicated widely or actively endorsed by senior business leadership and middle managers.  Nobody is really walking the talk.   <br /><br /></li></ul>
<p><strong>Keys to a successful code</strong><br />
If you think your code of conduct needs a revamp, take three key things into consideration:</p>
<ul><li>The <strong><em>content</em></strong> you write</li><li>The <strong><em>process</em></strong> you follow</li><li>The <strong><em>tools</em></strong> you use to produce and communicate your code</li></ul>
<p><strong>Content is key</strong><br />
The success of your code is largely determined by how effective and persuasive the content is. Here are some tips for writing good content:</p>
<ul><li>Be mindful of your audience: I see many codes of conduct that are little more than a long, disjointed list of risk areas that happen to be front of mind for compliance professionals at any given time.  Remember, you are writing to try to influence the behavior of employees and they simply do not experience risk in those same silos.  Write for your target audience and consider framing your code around your key stakeholders' needs and concerns: the business processes they are involved in and the likely ethical dilemmas they will face.</li><li>Be authentic:  Readers of your code, particularly employees, understand your corporate culture and 'how things are done around here'.  Your readers will not respond favorably to a document that does not feel authentic.  Even if your business has experienced compliance issues in the past, your code can signal a sea change and can be a valuable tool to set out your honest aspirations for the future.</li><li>Be practical: Readers will engage with your code if they sense value.  Rather than telling them about their legal obligations, help them understand how the law applies to them and where they can get help and advice if they need it.</li><li>Be emotional: Research shows the strong connection between emotion and decision making.  This is a well-understood concept in the worlds of marketing and behavioral economics and can arguably be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of codes of conduct.  If you want your code of conduct to influence ethical decision making then you should focus on the 'why' as well as the 'what' and the 'how' of compliance and ethics.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Perfect your process</strong><br />
The process of drafting, reviewing, and approving a code of conduct can be long and convoluted.  Through revisions and multiple stakeholder input, we often lose sight of the most important group: the readers.  <br /><br />
If you want to know if your code of conduct is going to have the desired impact then you need to <strong>market test</strong> it, just as you would with any new product.  Test both the content and the media you are planning to use with your target audience through focus groups and interviews with a representative sample of code users. Moreover, be prepared to take on board what you learn.<br /><br />
Also, think about the process you are going to use to distribute your code.  A well-orchestrated launch or re-launch campaign can be a great vehicle for refocusing your organization on ethical issues.  And, consider the power of the marketing inspired 'call to action' - that is, actually requiring readers to do something with the code.  This could be as simple as having employees certify that they have read and agree to abide by it.  Not only does this create a valuable audit trail but there is evidence to suggest that signing up to what can be perceived as an 'honor code' can cause people to behave more ethically.  (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onLPDegxXx8" title="Dan Airely's">Dan Ariely's</a> fascinating Ted Talk to learn more about his experiments in this area.)<br /><br /><strong>The right tools for the job</strong><br />
While a print-on-paper document may look good on the coffee table in the lobby, there is a now a wealth of digital tools that can make your code of conduct more accessible, interactive, and of genuine value to employees.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/almost-half-of-smartphone-users-spend-more-than-5-hours-a-day-on-their-mobile-device/" title="Recent research">Recent research</a> suggests that almost half of all smartphone users spend more than five hours a day on their mobile devices, and also spend more time online on their phones than computers. Although a mobile phone may not be the delivery mechanism you've traditionally used in the past for a multi-page document like a Code of Conduct, it does offer some unique benefits. The technology itself creates new opportunities to engage your target audience with key messages and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory" title="nudges">nudges</a> to drive appropriate behaviors in the workplace, while also offering the flexibility to access and consume the information in your Code of Conduct more easily than if it were printed on paper or saved on their computer at work. <br /><br />
Aside from your target audience, consider what tools you can provide to senior leaders and managers to equip them to become willing and active advocates of your code of conduct.  Middle managers are one of the most <a href="https://www.oecd.org/corruption/integrity-forum/academic-papers/Filabi.pdf" title="influential groups">influential groups</a> when it comes to impacting employee behavior.  Get them to believe in your code of conduct as a business enabler, and arm them with the knowledge and skills to pass that belief onto their teams.<br /><br /><strong>Do you need to breathe new life into your code of conduct?</strong><br />

<p>We read newspaper headlines such as “<em>Online credit card fraud on the rise, accounting for 78 per cent of total card fraud in Australia</em>”[1] all of the time. The recent high profile e-conveyancing related PEXA breach[2] shines a spotlight on the risks associated with transacting online yet again. </p>
<p>Having a better understanding of the common techniques employed by hackers (such as phishing) is a good starting point to better understand the risks associated with transacting online. And beyond that, you need to take some real action to reduce the <em>additional</em> risks. Our recent webinar “<em>Transacting Online - The Risks and Opportunities</em>” considered these, plus more.</p>
<p>As 93% of Australians have internet access[3], and many have or will transact online, it was great to see so many people in attendance at the webinar. Looking at the poll response rate and the number of questions posted at the Q&amp;A session, we can easily conclude that we are all keen to be better educated to mitigate the risks, so we can enjoy the convenience that comes with transacting online.</p>
<p><em><strong>Insecure about your online security?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's a recap of the tips we shared at the webinar:</p>
<ul><li>Verify the identity of the person or entity with whom you are transacting</li><li>Use two-factor authentication when executing a transaction</li><li>Check and enhance the integrity of passwords</li><li>Opt to receive automatic updates on web browsers and operating systems</li><li>Use up-to-date security software</li><li>Backup data both online and offline</li></ul>
<p>And here's our <em>top tip</em> - education is the <em>key</em> to reducing risk exposure. For Australia and New Zealand, we support the help available via IDCARE, ANZ's national identity and cyber support service.[4] In our webinar, we introduced <a href="https://www.idcare.org/cyber-first-aid-kit">IDCARE's Cyber First Aid Kit</a> as a convenient online tool that provides cyber first aid. Anyone who needs to understand what's happening, such as any unusual account activities, the Cyber First Aid Kit can help diagnose the problem. If treatment of a problem is needed, the “Treatments and Prescriptions” function enables the user to identify the topics of relevance, then access IDCARE's Fact Sheets and Video Demonstrations.</p>
<p>With improved awareness of what <em>can</em> go wrong, and what to do <em>if</em> something goes wrong, the community can be a much better place to enjoy the benefits of online transactions, including e-conveyancing. For those that attended the webinar, we hope we helped you better understand the risks and opportunities related to transacting online.

The view that corporate agents were only responsible for profit encouraged institutions to keep their mandate narrowly focused on shareholders' expectations. This, in turn, led to a dangerous confirmation bias: on the one hand, Corporate Social Responsibility and ethics advocates became increasingly convinced that business, having profit as its only objective, could not be ethical. On the other hand, corporate agents became concerned that environmentalists and regulators might be out to get them and curb their freedom.</p>
<p>As companies started facing increasing complexity and change, the costs and missed opportunities of a mandate designed to only meet shareholders' expectations grew apparent. Contradicting the acquired belief that ethics and business partake in a zero-sum game, the pattern of ethical failures of the past 20 years has made it clear that siloing ethics and business practices are extremely costly.</p>
<p>As ethical risk has ratcheted up, organizations have had to take a closer look at the root causes of corporate failures. The idea that malfeasance is simply authored by a few rogue employees does not square with the type of systemic failures that have unfolded in recent years. Although a rogue individual can, in some cases, do significant damage, framing the issue in terms of 'a few bad apples' is neither accurate, nor has it actually helped institutions mitigate risk.</p>
<p> </p>

<div class="embed-container" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gzAZ-NmCJt4?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p> </p>
<p>For starters, people do not operate in a vacuum. That is, it is difficult to explain how bad apples get to do what they want despite the existence of various lines of control-policies and rules, peer pressure, behavioral norms and expectations, performance evaluations, and other formal and informal mechanisms. Though the overall organizational context may not be actively 'conspiring,' the cradling of certain beliefs, biases and expectations can go a long way in diffusing responsibility and letting bad actors operate without checks and balances.  </p>
<p>Plenty of behavioral insights show that there is far greater risk in regular people being nudged toward a slippery slope by the wrong context than in rogue sociopaths starting a disastrous domino effect. Given the systemic nature that most ethical failures display nowadays, the argument of 'a few bad apples' is hardly enough to exempt senior leaders from the obligation of providing effective oversight and guidance. Finally, so long as organizations continue to believe that risk resides in the potential actions of a few, they forego the opportunity to build the right type of organizational context. A context (i.e., culture) that makes it harder for people to choose the wrong course of action and easier for them to act as engaged organizational citizens.</p>
<p>Mapping business to ethics and ethics to business should be a top priority for organizations not just to avoid unnecessary costs, but as part of their long-term planning. Since very few choices entail ethical neutrality nowadays, it is likely that people will feel compelled to take an active stand based on their personal ethics when it comes to purchasing, choosing an employer, staying engaged at work, and acting as an ambassador. This is why ethical issues have spilled over from the purview of professional activists to become the object of daily conversations. Upon discovering that customers might be more likely to buy from ethical companies and that candidates and employees might find it easier to associate themselves with ethical institutions, organizations may open up to the idea that the relationship between ethics and business has significantly fewer constraints and more opportunities than what had been traditionally thought. The fact that business leaders like <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/larry_fink_s_call_to_action__a_new_breed_of_risk_requires_a_new_breed_of_excellence/" title="Larry Fink">Larry Fink</a>, <a href="https://work.qz.com/1253580/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-tells-60-minutes-about-his-reckoning-with-the-gender-pay-gap/" title="Mark Benioff">Mark Benioff</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2017/11/21/paul-polman-why-todays-leaders-need-to-commit-to-a-purpose/#72735b1e1276" title="Paul Polman">Paul Polman</a> and others have taken action to leverage ethics for business growth is a telltale sign of this new trend.  </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/SAIG_Quotes_2_4_30.png" /></div><p>This new landscape forces companies to look more closely at their ethical orientation. And this is how SAI Global's <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1060" title="Strategic Culture Framework (SCF)">Strategic Culture Framework (SCF)</a> makes a unique contribution. The SCF highlights the specific systems, norms, and mindsets that organizations should focus on to fully map the way ethics and business relate to each other in the organization. There are two culture dimensions that are especially important to reduce risk and increase ethical growth according to the framework. These are the:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Delegation of Ethical Dilemmas</strong> - the extent to which the culture creates dilemmas and leaves them unaddressed; and</li><li><strong>Ethical Capacity</strong> - the resources, practices, and resilience that affect how people in the organization respond to ethical challenges.</li></ul>
<p>As highlighted in the SCF, the relationship between business and ethics extends beyond talk (e.g., 'Integrity is one of our values') <a href="http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2018/6/26/caterina-bulgarella-why-good-words-can-produce-bad-acts.html" title="to focus on the actual 'walk'">to focus on the actual 'walk'</a> (e.g., how and for what people are rewarded; what is implicitly demanded of them; etc.). When fully mature, this relationship characterizes a work environment that supports employees in a variety of ways as they engage with conflicting priorities and contradictory stances. For example, reducing dilemmas is not simply about taking time to acknowledge how key decisions are consistent with corporate values, but also about reflecting on the ways that decisions may fail to fully integrate ethics and business, and ways that deeper integration can be sought out going forward (e.g., which actors, which input, which timeline, which goals, which indicators of success.).</p>
<p>The SCF enables a fundamental reframe, helping organizations determine whether ethics practices have merely been superimposed upon business practices rather than being fully married to them. It is by addressing the contradictions that define internal processes and operations, the conflicting demands placed on stakeholders and the gap between what is said and what is done, that the framework aptly highlights both risk and potential for ethical performance. It is through this reframe that organizations can discover foregone opportunities for sustainable growth and long-term resilience.</p>

Companies' reputations are at risk, executive careers could go down in flame and shame, and the narratives around business are becoming more opaque with each new story of corporate misconduct becoming public. </p>
<p>One scandal after another, the evidence is mounting: when culture goes bad, the whole system suffers from a giant blind spot.</p>
<p>Today's leaders can neither just assume that they are immune to the consequences of a toxic culture, nor can they think that these risks are not theirs. The odds of becoming the next Wells Fargo, Volkswagen, or Miramax are scarily increasing for all institutions. In fact, it is becoming impossible to effectively manage an organization without the right culture frames and tools.</p>
<p>This is why SAI Global introduced the <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1060" title="Strategic Culture Framework (SCF)">Strategic Culture Framework (SCF)</a>, a strategic tool that allows organizations to assess and manage ethical risk. The SCF highlights the two culture coordinates that produce the highest level of risk in an organization. These are the delegation of ethical dilemmas, which is how and whether the organization introduces conflicting priorities that force people to face up to difficult ethical tradeoffs, and ethical capacity. </p>
<p>In the companion post to this topic, I reviewed the <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/using_the_strategic_culture_framework_to_map_ethics_and_business/" title="link between business and ethics">link between business and ethics</a>, and how the link seemingly deteriorated over time. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Untitled%20design%20(69).png" /></div><p><strong>To better understand how the framework helps assess and manage ethical risk, let's consider a real case study: the Deepwater Horizon debacle in 2010 and BP's culture leading to it.</strong></p>
<p>We know that prior to the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, there was a marked gap between BP's touted values and what the organization actually valued, namely aggressive growth and risk-taking. BP was winning sustainability awards and checking all the boxes in terms of creating the right internal governance structures, but its culture fueled ethical dilemmas. Committees, not business leaders, were put in charge of ethics; people worked under pressure, including pressure to comply, affecting their ability to engage in sound reasoning.</p>
<p>Though some key stakeholders spoke out, senior leadership exercised their influence in a way that drowned discordant feedback. If evaluated in the abstract, BP's exposure to risk was considerable. That risk was untenable if looked at in the context of what the Deepwater Horizon's stakes truly entailed. But in the absence of frames and tools that could help look at the pattern of events taking place in more strategic terms, BP misread all the key warning signs.</p>
<p>We know how the story ended: 11 deaths, a host of harmful environmental consequences for the Gulf of Mexico and a $65 billion price tag for BP. </p>
<p>BP would have scored low on the two SCF's culture axes, showing dangerous flaws consistent with a profile of systemic risk. To be clear, the two culture dimensions highlighted in the framework, Delegation of Ethical Dilemmas and Ethical Capacity, are both critical to understand the intensity and type of risk an organization faces. The more dilemmas in the organization, the more pressure people are likely to face, translating to higher ethical risk. Moreover, the types of dilemmas internal stakeholders must routinely address (around safety, innovation, and process) shed light on the nature of the risk and how it may play out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The level of Ethical Capacity in an organization is indicative of whether or not the risk ensuing from conflicting priorities will lead to a bad outcome.</strong></p>
<p>In an organization where Ethical Ownership is low, we can expect that people will be more likely to give in if they feel under pressure, thinking that it's not their responsibility to challenge how things are done. Similarly, if Ethical Reasoning is not strong, employees will likely be biased in the face of ethical challenges, discounting important factors or ignoring key pieces of information. And if Ethical Voice is feeble, people may be unwilling to speak out, which will cause risk to escalate. </p>
<p>The profile of an organization along the SCF's two axes is critical in establishing the maturity of the organization's culture and the risk that culture creates. A culture is mature when the organization works hard to address and contain dilemmas on the one hand, while creating ethical capacity on the other. A culture is immature when the opposite is true. In between mature and immature cultures, there are two types that pose uniquely different challenges: ambivalent cultures and righteous cultures. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Cultures.png" /></div><p>In an ambivalent culture, there typically are adequate conditions for Ethical Capacity. People are encouraged to own ethical challenges: they are trained effectively, their reasoning is engaged, tough issues are discussed openly, and there is awareness about what works and what doesn't. However, the culture is ambivalent because the organization does not stave off unnecessary dilemmas. Such organizations, for example, might nurture a culture of infinite 'ands.' Be profitable and efficient and high quality and safe and of high integrity. Companies that fall into this category may have mature <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/ethics_and_learning/" title="ethics and compliance learning">ethics and compliance learning</a> programs, but that doesn't mean they have a mature culture.</p>
<p>By contrast, organizations with a righteous culture go to great lengths to articulate clear and strong priorities, but they don't do as good a job when it comes to Ethical Capacity. Righteous cultures are somewhat cultish. Their risk arises not from pressure and lack of clarity, but from acquiescence and lack of adaptability. </p>
<p>Risk is lowest in mature cultures because these organizations do a great job in avoiding unnecessary dilemmas and in preparing their people to address ethical challenges. Risk is highest in immature cultures because these organizations let dilemmas proliferate, and they fail to nurture ethical capacity. Righteous organizations face more risk than mature organizations but less risk than immature ones. They have clear priorities, but they do not adequately prepare employees to deal with situations that deviate from the script. For this reason, the amount of risk a righteous organization faces will very much depend upon the environment and business in which it operates.</p>
<p>Ambivalent organizations do their homework when it comes to ethical capacity, but they let dilemmas flourish. As a result, they face moderately high risk. Ambivalent cultures may be born from a desire to do it all, which creates a dangerous form of motivated blindness. This is why these organizations are more intent on mitigating the negative consequences of ethical risk than on curbing that risk to begin with.</p>

Whether it is empowering employees, working with suppliers, or engaging customers, organizations have the ability to make a serious impact on this global human rights crisis.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/g-953113182_Blog_640pxwide.jpg" /></div><p>It's hard to comprehend that there are now twice as many people enslaved in the world as there were in the 350 years of the transatlantic slave trade. According to some researchers, the average modern slave is bought for just $90 USD - compare this to 200 years ago where the average slave was sold for a price tag that equates to $40,000 USD today. As a bit of perspective, humans are being bought and sold for the average price of a monthly cell phone bill.</p>
<p>Though now universally illegal, slavery does still exist and is happening every hour of the day, affecting some <a href="https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/global-findings/#footnote:1">40 million</a> men, women, and children. Many of these victims are trafficked, stripped of their foundational values and structures of civilization, and plunged into one of the largest and fastest-growing organized clandestine criminal enterprises on earth. Slavery represents a <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_243201/lang--en/index.htm">$150 billion</a> empire that thrives on the exploitation of the desperate and impoverished.</p>
<p>It is an empire that bridges failed states with weak or no institutions and strickened economies to the advanced high-income post-industrial democracies. As former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry once <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/258876.pdf">noted</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Wherever we find poverty and lack of opportunity… we find not just vulnerability to trafficking, but zones of impunity where traffickers can prey on their victims.</p><p>John Kerry</p><p>Former United States Secretary of State</p></blockquote><p>From factories and fisheries to brothels and migrant camps, modern slavery touches our daily lives and continues to work its way into global supply chains, where some of the goods and services that we purchase every day may be tainted by the blood and sweat of forced labor. </p>
<h3>The Buck Stops Here</h3>
<p>Through extensive media interest and increasing levels of scrutiny by consumers, organizations have seen the reputational and financial implications for business grow, as a result of ties to modern slavery, human trafficking, or child labor. Regardless of whether they are legally obligated to or not, corporations should constantly be assessing and identifying slavery and trafficking risks across their operations and within their supply chains. These risks include consumer backlash and potential shareholder divestment, among others. </p>
<p>When it comes to supply chains and reputational risk, cast your mind back to the 1990s, where a global sportswear giant was plagued with reports that it was employing child labor under sweatshop conditions within its supply chain. The company's image was tarnished and its bottom line sales took a nosedive. It was then forced to spend the next decade cleaning up its act to hold on to consumers.</p>
<p>This murky world of modern slaves in supply chains is an abuse of human rights in the pursuit of profits. Organizations have a duty not to indulge or tolerate it, whether deliberately or recklessly. This isn't charity or philanthropy; it is how an organization should run its core business. </p>
<p>By tackling modern slavery head on, companies have an opportunity to demonstrate leadership in responsible business practices that can translate into more resilient and transparent supply chains and increased brand equity.</p>
<h3>Tackling the Weak Links in Supply Chains </h3>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/28/cosmetics-companies-mica-child-labour-beauty-industry-india-">cosmetics</a>, <a href="https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Media-Centre/Blog/2017/April/What-do-you-know-about-modern-slavery-in-fashion">clothes</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/14/shrimp-sold-by-global-supermarkets-is-peeled-by-slave-labourers-in-thailand">shrimp</a> and <a href="https://www.gadgetmatch.com/smartphones-support-slavery-global-slavery-index-2018/">smartphones</a>, supply chains are incredibly complex, often with multiple layers spanning several countries. This alone makes it challenging to pinpoint and tackle exploitation, which is why detecting and eliminate modern slavery from a global supply chain is no small task. </p>
<p>Organizations need to first evaluate the effectiveness of their existing supply chain management systems and leverage technology and partnerships to connect those in sectors at risk with relevant stakeholders along the supply chain. Employee training is also a key component to tackle modern slavery for it is a clandestine crime. Being able to spot the signs is critical to ensure an organization's supply chain is slave-free.</p>
<p>Such actions will be challenging for organizations given the pressure on driving costs down and the complex nature of supply chains. However, they should see this as an opportunity to get ahead of the issue, taking the time to invest in the supplier relationships, increase transparency, and work toward building more resilient and ethical supply chains.</p>

Verification of a client's identity is an essential part of risk management for any business. </p>
<p>KYS (or 'know your supplier') is just as important. We must take care to know who with whom we are doing business - this may be a company's director, an on-seller, a brand representative, or a supplier of goods or services - because how they conduct themselves can affect us, both positively and negatively,. </p>
<p>As the work of the <a href="https://financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx">Banking Royal Commission</a> continues, we have all seen how misconduct of representatives can undo brand reputation and <a href="http://www.saiglobal.com/consumertrustindex">customer trust</a>. If financial institutions had done proper due diligence on their representatives, some of them would not be in the negative spotlight as much as they are right now.</p>
<p>Our recent webinar “<em>Know Who You're Doing Business With - Are they 'fit and proper'?</em>” discussed how we can safeguard reputation and reduce financial risk. Here are some of the due diligence tips we shared:</p>
<ul><li>Utilise Verification of Qualification services provided by educational institutions to check the qualifications claimed by a person. <a href="https://student.unsw.edu.au/qualification-verification">UNSW</a> is one of the universities that provide such a free service.</li><li>Utilise information on public registers. Among other things, ASIC's <a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asics-registers/banned-and-disqualified/">banned and disqualified</a> search provides information about people who have been disqualified from involvement in the management of a corporation, or banned from practising in the Australian financial services or credit industry.</li></ul>
<p>And this is perhaps the most informative tip of the webinar: consider a business' historic company information for valuable insights. Things like the length of service of directors can help identify turnover volume and frequency, speaking to stability of the counterparty of a commercial relationship. <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/property_certificates__settlements_and_conveyancing/dynamic_reports/">SAI Global's Dynamic Company Report</a> (part of the Dynamic Reports suite of solutions) provides this and other helpful information. This is a handy due diligence tool that gives unique company snapshots by highlighting the key information needed to give a good understanding at a glance. Customers who use our reports <a href="http://ps3.saiglobal.com/dynamicreports">have seen an 80% direct saving in HR</a> spend due to the reduced amount of time that it takes to order, interpret and analyse data. </p>
<p>Once the relevant commercial information has been collected, next is the analysis and interpretation phases. The outcome of these phases to make defendable and actionable business decisions. One way to improve and accelerate this is the use of data visualisation.  Did you know there are now university courses that focus on how decision makers can (and should) use visualisation to deal with business challenges? The University of Sydney's <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2018/infs/infs6023.html">Data Visualisation</a> unit of study is just one example. One tip is to start with the end-goal in mind. Re-think the search process in a visual way - users of the <a href="http://ps3.saiglobal.com/dynamicreports">Dynamic Company and Securities Report</a> can instantly visualise the data through a link to Encompass, displaying people, companies and addresses their associations in an interactive visual workspace. This helps discover otherwise hidden links using a manual search, empowering us to make the right commercial decision, including who we should (and should not) do business with.</p>
<p>There are fantastic tools and solutions, such as <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/compliance_and_risk/digital_risk_software/applications/vendor_risk_management/">SAI Global's own Vendor Risk Management solutions</a>, that should be part of our KYS due diligence so we can really know who we are doing business with.</p>

First up: Gerald Beuchelt, CISO at LogMeIn, as excerpted from <em>The Making of the Modern CISO </em><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1345">eBook</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Modern CISOs raise the bar by</strong></p>
<ul><li>running headlong into the cybersecurity fray,</li><li>feeding a hunger for exciting new security and business challenges, and</li><li>striving to meet high personal expectations.</li></ul>
<p>In this first profile, peer into the life of Gerald Beuchelt, one of four CISOs featured in <em>The Making of the Modern CISO</em>. Follow Beuchelt from the beginnings of his passion for protecting privacy. Learn of his vision for security. Understand what new challenges this modern CISO faces. And share his apprehension about an alarming new threat.</p>
<h3><strong>That First Spark</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Gerald Beuchelt</strong>, <strong>CISO</strong> at <strong>LogMeIn</strong>, developed a passion for protecting privacy after he Googled his name and found a lot of personal information online. He exclaims, “It was so easy to find all this information about me quickly on various websites I'd never heard of before!”</p>
<p>“It motivated me to protect my family and apply what I learned to larger companies. I care deeply about people's security and privacy,” he says. “It keeps me grounded.”</p>
<h3><strong>CISO Self-Image and the View from Gerald's Seat</strong></h3>
<p>Beuchelt juggles many responsibilities while fostering a positive vision for security and his role in it. “Security isn't just sitting in a corner, protecting networks, and saying 'No!' to people's requests. I see myself balancing security requirements with business conditions and allowing the company to innovate as fast as we can,” says Beuchelt.</p>
<p>“At the same time,” he continues, “I see myself maintaining a high degree of confidentiality and integrity for the properties that we have internally, as well as those that we implement for our customers.”</p>
<h3><strong>New Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<p>There's a fair amount of PR and marketing involved in building customer trust, but the CISO has a role to play here, too. “Talking in detail about the security program with a certain level of authority is important for the company, to protect this trust,” says Beuchelt.</p>
<p>“PR and marketing have become much more visible than they were ten years ago. That's something that really has changed for me personally,” he says.</p>
<h3><strong>Cyber Threats and Losing Sleep</strong></h3>
<p>There's an alphabet soup of cyber threats, from APTs to Zinapps (a rogue security software infection). Which one keeps Gerald Beuchelt up at night?</p>
<p>“I'm worried about the malicious use of AI,” says Beuchelt. “You can use it to impersonate voices, edit live video on the fly while escaping detection, orchestrate attacks across many vectors, and target spear-phishing attacks en masse.”</p>
<p>“Obviously, we're looking at ways to deal with it. I think there's a lot of interesting potential in AI and machine learning solutions coming out that can help us with that. I feel that this is a topic we will be talking about for a few years to come,” he explains.</p>

Here's a recap of what we covered and some key thoughts on these important regulatory updates. You can view the webinar via the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Ipso Facto Law Reform - In Practice and Exemptions</strong></p>
<p>Recent law reform has introduced a new stay on enforcement of <em>ipso facto</em> clauses that previously allowed a contractual party to terminate a contract when an insolvency event arose. You can read more about the reform <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd1718a/18bd033#_Toc492897580">here</a>. In practice, contractual parties need to consider how the new ipso facto regime might affect commercial arrangements entered into on or after 1 July 2018.</p>
<p>It is worth understanding the types of contracts or rights that are exempted by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018C00485">Regulations</a> and the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018L00919">Ministerial Declaration</a>. This is the right way for not having the stay apply, as parties cannot contract out of the regime.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Developments - Their Impact on Your Business and the Controversial Centrelink Case</strong></p>
<p>In our webinar, we considered the impact of Australia's <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/notifiable-data-breaches-scheme">Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme</a> (commenced in February 2018) and the European Union's <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (commenced in May 2018). These recent changes to privacy legislation in Australia and in Europe present some real challenges for businesses. We also shared some practical tips on compliance. If you missed the webinar, or if you want to hear our tips for your business, you can access a recording of our webinar via the link below. We also recommend you read our <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/news_and_resources/industry_news/what__privacy_policy_has_4_s_s_in_it_/">Practical Steps on GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>The case of <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/ludicrous-privacy-decision-on-blogger-s-details-released-20180530-p4zifr.html">Ms Fox and Centrelink</a> generated much interest, as reflected in the answers to our webinar poll questions. In a nutshell, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner rather controversially confirmed that Centrelink's disclosure of Ms Fox's personal information was permitted under the Privacy Act. The Australian Privacy Principle Guidelines gave examples of when the regulator considers that an individual may reasonably expect disclosure of their personal information. This includes circumstances in which the individual has made negative comments about an entity to the media about the way the entity has treated them. </p>
<p>It is fair to conclude that, despite that the decision is consistent with how the law is applied, many people (including our attendees) seem to think that it is not consistent with community expectations. The lesson here is summarised well by the saying, “<em>just because you can, doesn't mean you should</em>”, as there may be commercial and reputational ramifications following disclosure despite it being permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Banking Royal Commission - Findings and Learnings from Rounds 3 and 4</strong></p>
<p>A similar theme was present at the <a href="https://financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au/public-hearings/Pages/default.aspx">public hearings</a> at the <a href="https://financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx">Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry</a>. The evidence heard at the hearings has shown that even when the conduct of financiers seems to comply with the relevant laws and regulatory guidelines, the outcomes for consumers can still fall below the standards expected by the community. This is certainly something financiers need to take into consideration.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission's interim report is due by 30 September 2018, and a final report and findings are due on 1 February 2019. The Commission's term may be extended, and this is something many people are keeping a watchful eye on.</p>

Discover the 4 campaign steps.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"></p><p>The average employee working in an office receives 121 emails per day. If we had to rank all of those emails in their inbox from 'most' to 'least' exciting, I'd venture to guess that the one from their compliance department containing mandatory <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/risk/ethics_and_compliance/" title="ethics and compliance training">ethics and compliance training</a> (E&amp;C) they need to complete is pretty close to 'least' exciting.</p>
<p>As someone who genuinely believes in the value and importance of driving ethical and compliant behavior, finding new and innovative ways to change that reaction is always on my mind. But why the lack of excitement? </p>
<p>My personal experiences hinge upon two driving forces behind the current perception of ethics and compliance training among the modern workforce: <strong>time</strong> and <strong>perceived value</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Changing behavior through learning: a matter of time </strong></h4>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/learning-thought-leadership/introducing-the-2018-workplace-learning-report--talent-developme" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> asked 2,200 employees, 1,200 talent developers, 400 managers, and 200 executives how their workplace learning could be improved. The consensus wasn't that people don't want to learn new things, but that people simply don't have enough time to do so. When it comes to learning at work, survey participants shared that it's not just what they learn that matters, but when they can digest that information, where they can access it, and why it matters to them. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/LinkedIn.jpg" /></div><p><em><sup>source: <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2018?trk=lilblog_02-27-18_WLR-2018-launch-blog_tl&amp;cid=70132000001AyziAAC#" title="LinkedIn report">LinkedIn report</a></sup></em></p>
<p>This is reinforced by research conducted by <a href="https://mrmck.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/modernlearner.jpg" title="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>, who found that the average employee can only devote 1% of their time to any formal learning - just 24 minutes a week! In their minds, every minute spent consuming training is one minute less they have to do their jobs, especially if they can only do it on their computer at their desk. </p>
<p>That trade-off is even more evident when the training itself isn't valued by the employee, or adding value to how they can do their jobs. <br /><br /></p>
<h4><strong>Communicating the value of ethics and compliance</strong></h4>
<p>In our research over recent years, we have observed the trend that some employees continue to harbor a particularly negative impression of ethics and compliance learning. Many struggle to see how it contributes to making their day-to-day jobs any easier, safer or better, and sometimes even see it as a waste of their time.</p>
<p>There may once have been some truth in this, but with <a href="http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2018/6/26/caterina-bulgarella-why-good-words-can-produce-bad-acts.html" title="well-known corporate scandals">well-known corporate scandals</a> making headlines, ethics and compliance learning is more important than ever in the challenge to reduce risk and protect reputations.</p>
<p>Deloitte's research also found that “today's employees are overwhelmed, distracted and impatient” and when it comes to learning, they want to “take more control over their own development.”  Ethics and compliance learning competes with all of the messaging, information, media, and distractions to which employees are increasingly exposed. To be heard, it needs to rise above the noise. </p>
<p>This can only be achieved if employees can see the value that it offers. So before we can train, we need to convince employees of the value ethics and compliance learning will offer, and win their buy-in that these learning experiences are a valuable, and even essential, use of their time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Convincing with campaigns: a flexible approach </strong></h4>
<p>Convincing is a process, and like any process, it takes a number of steps over time, with each step focused on achieving a particular purpose. The easiest way to think about campaigns are through the lens of advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>To convince you to buy their latest brand of coffee, a beverage company might conduct a campaign using a range of different advertising channels and marketing techniques throughout four main steps: Discovery, Consideration, Conversion, and Retention. </p>
<p>Throughout the four-steps of that campaign, the beverage company will make you aware of that new product by leveraging traditional advertising (print, TV, radio) and digital advertising (social media, sponsored content, podcasts), help you understand why you may want to try it, make it easy for you to buy it, and ultimately, nurture that relationship so you stay a customer. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/marketing%20campaign%204%20steps%20aug%202018%20moz.JPG" /></div><p><em><sup>source: <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-content-marketing/marketing-funnel " title="Moz.com">Moz.com</a></sup></em></p>
<p>Seeing a commercial once isn't enough to make you buy that coffee, just as learning about something one time isn't enough to make you remember it, let alone think about it when it matters. Like advertising and marketing, learning is ultimately about changing behavior, and changing behavior is driven through repetition. </p>
<p>If you can fundamentally agree with that idea, then taking a campaign-based approach can also be a very successful way to deliver an effective learning experience. When we help global organizations build ethics and compliance programs to address risks and protect their brand, we aspire to go beyond time-consuming, one-time training courses. We think like marketers trying to change someone's behavior and break the learning experience up into four steps, too: </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Campaign%204%20Steps.JPG" /></div><p><em><sup>source: SAI Global</sup></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>1. Prime (Discovery):</strong> Like any good advertisement, this stage is all about making someone aware of a new concept (a risk topic or cultural value) and helping them recognize that they have a learning need. <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>2. Train (Consideration):</strong> At this stage, you're going to deliver key knowledge about that new concept (in-depth training), and engage each individual so they develop the right attitudes around that concept. <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>3. Apply (Conversion):</strong> This is when you help each individual transfer the information they've discovered and considered into the desired outcome. For ethics and compliance programs, it's all about connecting the dots to operationalize the training they've been given in the context of their roles and responsibilities. <br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>4. Sustain (Retention):</strong> The last stage isn't the end of your journey, but a constant effort to continue embedding that desired outcome and behavior. For a beverage company, it means buying that product again. For your ethics and compliance program, it means helping someone maintain what they've learned and reinforce why it's important to them. </p>
<p>Done well, taking a campaign-based approach to ethics and compliance learning can help employees recognize the value your program provides and make it easier for them to engage with that information. Making these experiences more flexible shows employees that you value their time, and by doing that, you might just change their perception of ethics and compliance too. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Richard Bistrong</strong>: When we have an organization where ethics, integrity, and compliance is coming out of the voice of the E&amp;C function, to me, that sounds like a support function. When business leaders, P&amp;L owners...when they are the voice of integrity, that doesn't sound like a support function. That sounds like 'hey this is our corporate narrative. This is how we work.' It's intertwined and it's anchored to our tasks at hand.<br /><br /><strong>Caterina Bulgarella</strong>: Absolutely, I agree 100%. The one thing to keep in mind to get there, to get that type of integration, I think is to work through certain beliefs. And some of these beliefs can be quite inaccurate. The belief that there may be an inherent conflict between ethics and business can really prevent us from getting there. <br /><br /><strong>Richard Bistrong</strong>: To think that they're in two different siloes.<br /><br /><strong>Caterina Bulgarella</strong>: Exactly. There needs to be a process through which business leaders can appreciate the strategic implications of ethics. So that's why <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1060" title="a framework">a framework</a> can be helpful. A framework that connects the dots and puts together some important practice areas, and how those practice areas can effect key outcomes, starting with risk, starting with conduct in the organization, and a number of other outcomes; that can be very beneficial.<br /><br /><strong>Richard Bistrong:</strong> So let's stay with that subject of leadership. Because you talk about how leadership behavior is a strong variable that can impact the delegation of ethical dilemmas, and in my work, I see this as such a positive or negative; the impact that leadership behaviors can have. So where do you see this? Let's focus on the positive; how leadership can really tip people in the right direction. And not everybody in a global organization is reporting to the CEO, so what part of leadership in an organization really needs to be on a forward foot when it comes to this? Because leadership is a broad word. <br /><br /><strong>Caterina Bulgarella:</strong> I completely agree, and I think it should be anyone in a position of power and influence. So yes, it's senior leadership, but also middle managers and managers in general. In terms of highlighting the positive impact that these stakeholders can have on employees in the organization in general, as you said before, I think it goes back to having that one voice. The voice where you see ethics and business coming together. It's a voice, also, of vulnerability. Acknowledging that there are difficult tensions, right. <br /><br /><strong>Richard Bistrong</strong>: I love that word. Vulnerability.<br /><br /><strong>Caterina Bulgarella</strong>: I think it's critical just to acknowledge that vulnerability. That's why I said before that sometimes we have this inaccurate belief that we cannot be vulnerable because it means that we are not going to win, or that we're conceding. Vulnerabilities are incredibly important, especially if you are important, a manager or in a leadership position, because they create space to explore things that we might be afraid of. Eventually, as we start exploring them, we can figure out that there is a way to reconcile what may appear as being at odds to begin with. It's so important to work through those beliefs. To really initiate new practices. Also, the courage of asking tough questions, which is not only when something is going poorly, but even when things go great, right? <br /><br /><strong>Richard Bistrong</strong>: How are we getting there?<br /><br /><strong>Caterina Bulgarella</strong>: Exactly! Those are the questions that nobody wants to ask. Why should we ask those questions, everything is going so well! But those are the times when those questions need to be asked.<br /><br /><strong>Richard Bistrong</strong>: Absolutely! Bad behavior can hide behind great performance. Those organizations that are willing to embrace uncertainty in their workforce, to show a little bit of vulnerability, humility, and humanity - it's ok, there is nothing wrong with being confused out there. We understand that this is a complex issue. Being uncertain is okay. What's important is to get on the phone and call us so we can learn in together as a team. <br /><br /></p>

Discover how he views the future.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"></p><p>If you've been following this series, you know <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1345">The Making of the Modern CISO</a> captures invaluable insights from four leading executives who open their vests to reveal rare perspectives on steering cybersecurity at the corporate level. </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/CISObook_blog_640px-wide.png" /></div><p>These pioneering security generals enlist all their might and senses in the struggle to upend cyber exploits whenever and wherever those exploits worm their way onto company networks. Last time, we heard from <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/follow_in_the_footsteps_of_four_modern_cisos_-_gerald_beuchelt/">Gerald Beuchelt</a>. Up this time is Richard Rushing, CISO at Motorola Mobility, another voice from <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1345">The Making of the Modern CISO eBook</a>.</p>
<p>Modern CISOs don't mince their emotions as they… </p>
<ul><li>feel the anguish of others' losses,</li><li>leap to the frontlines to act, and</li><li>lead with hearts full of hope.</li></ul>
<p>In this second portrait, join the odyssey of Richard Rushing, one of four CISOs highlighted in <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1345">The Making of the Modern CISO</a>. Share his burden as he shoulders the hardships of others. Race with him to douse the flames of incessant breaches. Speak the language of the board of directors just as he does. And envision the many cyber troops answering his call. </p>
<h3><strong>The Empathic CISO</strong></h3>
<p>Do you close yourself off when suffering strikes close to home, or do you have the courage to empathize with the weary soul sitting next to you? Richard Rushing, CISO at Motorola Mobility, had a personal encounter with an employee who lost all her baby pictures to ransomware on her company laptop. The experience was trying for both of them.</p>
<p>As much as caring for people in crisis can cost you, it's worth it to sit with them and empathize over the pain of their injuries. “At that moment, you see that person sitting across from you, and you have to have that conversation with them, and it touches you in a way that you don't expect. It's not an experience that I wish on anyone. It stays with you for a long time,” Rushing says.</p>
<h3><strong>The CISO in the Mirror</strong></h3>
<p>Richard Rushing sees himself as a first responder. “It's like being a firefighter. Some days it's hushed, and then other days constant alarms are going off, and you're putting out fires on a regular basis.” </p>
<p>“We've seen many breaches around the country and the world, and we've dealt with them,” Rushing says.</p>
<h3><strong>Precisely Speaking</strong></h3>
<p>Rushing sees communicating with the board as a precise skill with essential benefits. “You have to talk in simple terms. Discussing your company's relative maturity is a great way to find out where you rank yourselves. It's something the board can grasp very easily.”</p>
<p>“It's important to show the board the competitive landscape, as well. You need to point out your competitors and how they look when compared with your maturity level,” comments Rushing. “Knowing your maturity level and your competitors', the board is prepared to make better decisions about funding and personnel.”</p>
<h3><strong>A Bright Future for InfoSec</strong></h3>
<p>Rushing sees the world of cybersecurity through a positive filter. Contrary to the industry's take on a skills gap, he expects InfoSec pros will be plentiful.</p>
<p>“Though we live in the breach of the moment, there are lots of good things to look forward to in this business,” Rushing says. “I see more people moving into information security. Some of the more prime positions are going to take time to fill, but that's a time problem. People are eager to learn.”</p>

Learn more today.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">At the heart of any Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) or Integrated Risk Management (IRM) strategy, what's best for the customer, is what's best for the customer.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/SAI360_Tetris_Carousel_image_1200x630px_SOCIAL.png?n=3645" /></div><p>In today's always-on environment, organizations are exposed to more risks and new complex and fast-moving challenges to brand and reputation than we could ever have imagined ten years ago.  Our customers, along with leading industry analysts, signaled there is now a need to take an integrated approach to managing risk. It can no longer be effectively managed in silos; it needs to be connected.</p>







  


<p>We've seen huge changes in the GRC software landscape owing to a range of factors, including increased risk from digital transformation, intangible assets such as brand reputation increasingly driving business decisions and customers now using a wide range of different solutions, resulting in a fragmented risk management technology architecture. Organizations now require a comprehensive view of their risk and compliance management programs, providing them with a connected view that not only helps them mitigate a wider range of issues, but enables them to seek opportunities to maintain competitiveness, business resilience and ultimately, to grow.</p>







  


<p>We believe IRM provides this strategic, collaborative, and aggregated view of risk and compliance. It enables organizations to respond and adapt to change and disruption quickly and helps you to better understand the full scope of risk. It also allows you to be more innovative when responding to new risks presented by digital initiatives, in addition to the ever-present change in the risk and compliance landscape organizations operate within.</p>
<h3>Introducing SAI360</h3>







  


<p>This is why we are introducing SAI360, a comprehensive suite of solutions, that begins to bind our market-leading risk and compliance capabilities, learning content and services together. This provides our customers with a unique approach to meet their risk and compliance management needs.</p>







  


<p>SAI360 offers a new perspective on risk that will help us to deliver the best experience possible for our customers. It represents a more open, integrated and all-inclusive approach to risk and compliance that enables us to be more adaptive and flexible in the way that we think about what we offer to the market. Moreover, IRM will allow us to offer better assessment processes, compliance, ethics and values learning, risk culture and use data more strategically to help organizations meet the risk and resilience challenges they face.</p>







  


<p>Going forward, SAI360 will change the way we think and talk about our business. This connected view will allow us to have more strategic conversations with customers about our services, and deliver time to value. With the support of analytics and predictive modelling, we'll also be able to identify opportunities for new solutions and harness insights to maximize the effectiveness of the capabilities we're building.</p>







  


<p>Being ahead of the curve means that we can better support our customers by delivering the integrated approach to managing risk that they so desperately need. We now have the ability to empower customers to advance confidently by helping them to take a more integrated approach to risk, so their risk management strategies can finally fall into place. </p>

The New Year is right around the corner, and with it, a new set of training goals and launches. It's a time to be honest with ourselves, and I want to be honest with you. Here's the truth.  </p>
<p>Building an ethics and compliance program for a global, multi-lingual and multi-risk workforce is not easy. Changing behaviors around risk for thousands of unique people is a process built on repetition and reinforcement, not a quick-fix, checked box, or completion rate. </p>
<p>Creating a culture where employees engage with ethics and compliance learning content is not easy. We're swimming upstream against years of preconceived (and sometimes earned) opinions that the content isn't actually a helpful or valuable way to spend ones time, while new risks present themselves constantly. <br /><br />
Demonstrating program effectiveness and value with relevant data and analytics is not easy. We need to improve not just what we actually capture and measure so we have more data, but also the quality of the data itself. As part of that, we need to also improve the relevance of the experiences we deliver to each learner and why they're important to their jobs. We need to overcome a disconnect between our intention and execution. </p>
<p>Just because something isn't easy doesn't mean it isn't possible. In fact, the hardest problems to solve often require the best ideas and most thoughtful solutions. If we don't acknowledge the challenges associated with accomplishing our goals, then we're destined to continue down the path we're on today instead of working even harder to overcome the barriers in our way. In doing so, we fail to adapt to a business landscape that won't stop and wait for us to catch up.  </p>

<p>At the heart of any effective compliance program is a <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/the_4_elements_of_an_effective_ethics_and_compliance_campaign/" title="learning methodology">learning methodology</a> and <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/why_responsive_design_and_accessibility_create_a_better_ethics_and_compliance_learning_experience/" title="modern technology">modern technology</a>. A learning methodology, the logic and strategy behind how your program is built, addresses how we process, remember, and operationalize information today. Modern technology, the tools used to bring that program to life, is designed to deliver that content in alignment with a defined strategy, in an environment that can capture and measure the real data, analytics, and behavior we need to understand. In 2018, we've built <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/risk/ethics_and_compliance/" title="EthicsAnywhere">EthicsAnywhere</a> - a combination of learning methodology and modern technology, so you can take a learner-centric approach to E&amp;C. By doing so, you'll be able to remove traditional barriers of consumption to create engaging and measurably effective experiences. </p>
<h4><strong>Measuring Process vs. Measuring Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>The intentions of ethics and compliance professionals are to help employees do the right thing and behave ethically so their culture can prosper and their organization can manage risk. Those good intentions are challenged by various pressures, like regulations that fundamentally change the way an organization does business, to ambitious individual goals and targets that can pressure a learner to 'win' at the expense of integrity and legality. When handled poorly, pressure creates coal. When handled well, pressure creates diamonds.</p>
<p>When executing on these intentions today, the E&amp;C community often focuses on completing a series of tasks defined by regulatory bodies. When measuring the results of our efforts, the illusive concept of 'program effectiveness' is done through the lens of regulatory expectations. Often times, this neglects to consider if the actual learning experiences built for employees are effective in relation to what those intentions were. <br /><br /></p>

<p>When reflecting on her E&amp;C experiences in a recent <a href="https://www.bna.com/insight-measuring-process-n73014482090/" title="Bloomberg Law article">Bloomberg Law article</a>, Hui Chen summarized this concept well: the pedigree of an athlete isn't measured by their hours in a gym but instead by their performance in the game. “In the area of corporate compliance, however, the focus has remained on process, not outcome.”</p>
<p>From my perspective, the focus has remained on regulators, not learners. Looking ahead to 2019, my resolution as the VP of Learning at SAI Global is to help organizations take a learner-centric approach to their ethics and compliance programs, and in doing so, create a more accurate and honest definition of program effectiveness. </p>
<p>To do that, we'll have to overcome the four disconnects in ethics and compliance programs today: consumption, perception, evolution, and culture. Each of them are magnified by the growing consumerization of compliance; the undeniable fact that employee awareness around ethics and compliance issues has taken leaps forward, and so has the way technology influences how they comprehend and retain information. However, the driving forces behind the creation of E&amp;C programs in organizations are still largely the same. </p>

<h4><strong>The Four Disconnects</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The disconnect in consumption</strong> exists because how your organization delivers learning content to employees today is significantly different from how your employees engage with content and information in their lives whenever they aren't doing work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP222" title="Research we conducted">Research we conducted</a> in 2017 showed us that 93% of organizations do not deliver learning content on smartphones and 81% do not use adaptive learning to personalize experiences for each employee. <br /></strong><br />
Research conducted by <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics" title="WordStream">WordStream</a> tells us that everyone in your organization, not just Millennials, spend more time browsing the internet and watching videos on their phones than their computers or laptops, and everywhere they visit is personalized specifically to them. Yet the majority of E&amp;C programs today are delivering standardized, non-personalized or customized training to people that can only be engaged with at their desk on their computer.</p>
<p><strong>The disconnect in perception</strong> exists because of the difference between what regulators and employees think of your E&amp;C program. While two hours of 'click and continue' online Code of Conduct training could deem your program satisfactory from a regulator's perspective, it could also disengage that employee and negatively shape their perception of ethics and compliance in your organization. </p>

<p><strong>The disconnect in evolution</strong> exists because technology innovations and content trends move significantly faster than changes in laws and regulations, and the former is something your employee experience more directly than the latter. If you train employees on bribery and corruption in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the ways that you can deliver that information and they can consume it will change more significantly than any regulation or principle around the information itself over those 24 months. <br /><br /><strong>The final disconnect is focused on culture</strong>, because <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/linking_culture_and_risk__insights_from_the_strategic_culture_framework/" title="what people learn does not correlate with how they behave">what people learn does not correlate with how they behave</a>. Just because you trained someone once to be competent about a risk topic doesn't mean they'll act differently or confidently when presented with that risk in real life. </p>

<p>If you're interested in adapting to the growing consumerization of compliance and taking a learner-centric approach that addresses some of these disconnects, there's no better time to start than the present. These changes won't happen overnight. As an ethics and compliance professional, you're well aware that meaningful change can take time. So let me help you take the first step and serve as a guide on the beginning of your journey to true, data-driven, authentic program effectiveness. </p>

As part of that continued theme, we've just released our brand new <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1444" title="Compliance Coloring Book">Compliance Coloring Book</a>, designed to be an ethical escape from stress and burnout. </p>
<p>This year, we're focused on building new connections with members of the E&amp;C community so you can help each other succeed and overcome the challenges that come with the job.</p>
<p>To succeed as a compliance professional, it's important to be comfortable with the fact that culture and behavioral change takes time. Focus on achieving a few things each year and planning your compliance journey for the long term. With that <a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1444" title="big-picture">big-picture</a> perspective, it's easier to see the progress you make, cultural trends you're helping to shape, and communicate the benefits of that journey to get the support of your board.</p>
<p>Having worked with many organizations at various stages of their compliance journey, I'm sharing eight key things compliance officers can do to reduce some of the pressure that comes with the job:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>1. Don't create your compliance program in a silo</strong></h3>
<p>Take an <a href="http://www.sai360.com/" title="integrated risk management">integrated risk management</a> approach and work with the rest of your organization to help elevate your compliance program so it's built-in as opposed to bolted-on. Your corporate culture is the sum of all parts of the organization, and when both designing and implementing your compliance program, connect with the rest of the organization and benefit from the success of each initiative. Make sure your organization truly values its stated values. </p>
<p>If you value trust, demonstrate trusting people. If you value truth, make sure you have an open culture with no fear of speaking up. If you value integrity, celebrate when integrity was demonstrated.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/compliance_journey%20_-_tetris.png" /></div><h3><strong>2. Gather your crew</strong></h3>
<p>Don't go it alone. Amplify your efforts by recruiting ethics champions within your organization who can influence and help embed the importance of ethical decision making by sharing their own story and examples.  They can be another open door for employees to ask for guidance and address concerns outside of the formal team structure, fostering openness and trust throughout the organization. </p>
<h3><strong>3. Opportunityisnowhere</strong></h3>
<p><em>How did you read that title?</em> 'Opportunity is <u>nowhere</u>' or, 'Opportunity is <u>now here</u>'? Employees are more likely to be enthused by the positive impact of compliance, so flip the tone from 'it has to be done' to a positive message that builds self-governing interest so everyone feels responsible for taking part. When a strong ethical and compliance culture resonates from within your organization, it can create new opportunities to stand out from the competition, attract more customers, be more sustainable, and entice the best people to work in your organization. </p>
<h3><br /><strong>4. Don't waste time re-inventing the wheel</strong></h3>
<p>Like SAI Global, there are companies producing ethics and compliance learning content to meet your employee education needs.  These companies engage with subject matter experts, legal teams, research on your behalf and invest in the latest learning technology. Make the most of that, instead of re-inventing the wheel producing your own learning content. Cost savings may look good on paper in the short term, but ultimately your time is more valuable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>5. Adjust your branding focus</strong></h3>
<p>Creating a brand that encapsulates the very reason for all your compliance initiatives (e.g. 'Our Way') is extremely powerful in influencing how we behave. A brand can make your program more memorable and is something that sticks with employees over time.  <br /><br />
But when you have limited time to launch a new code or learning content, it's OK to adjust your branding focus. Ensure your licensed learning content is customizable and focus on achieving branding goals in the time you have.  Add your corporate logo, an introduction from the CEO, and relevant images, scenarios, and resources that reflect your globally diverse organization. All of these actions will help employees to relate to the content. You can make the various stages of branding a part of your long-term strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Measure in different ways</strong></h3>
<p>The most common question from compliance professionals are variants of 'How do I measure the effectiveness of my program?' I usually respond with 'What do you want to measure? Do you want to measure what I know, how I behave or what I should do, what I could do?' Ultimately, you need to answer internally 'What is the organization looking to achieve short term and long term?'  Measuring effectiveness can and should be done in many different ways and also at any time. Even if you only have twenty days to launch your compliance program, doesn't mean the opportunity to measure is lost.  </p>
<p>You can gather data analytics from online course interactions, culture assessments, incident focus groups, and so on - all of these count toward measuring the effectiveness. Some can be immediate (data analytics) and others best suited to long term strategy. There are many studies that prove how we change our behavior based on our circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/compliance_journey%20_-_measure.png" /></div><h3><strong>7. Give yourself time </strong></h3>
<p>I've worked with many compliance professionals who need to launch in one month. There's nothing wrong with that sometimes, but if your compliance program is just another item to tick off your 'to do' list, it will be received that way, and the tone and importance for your program will be lost.  If you want employees to spend time to understand and change behavior, then you also need to spend time making sure it's relevant and right. Be authentic with your approach to compliance.</p>
<h3><br /><strong>8. Look after yourself</strong></h3>
<p>The job you do as compliance professionals is hard work. You have a lot of stakeholders. You have a long journey ahead, so take time to focus and celebrate what you have achieved. Just because you didn't manage it this year, doesn't mean there isn't time next year.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Happy Compliance Officer Day</strong>, and if you aren't an ethics and compliance professional but made your way to the bottom of this post, send it to the compliance team in your organization! <em><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1444" title="And don't forget your Compliance Coloring Book!">And don't forget your Compliance Coloring Book!</a></em></p>

Discover what workplace bullying is and isn&#39;t and how it can affect your organization.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">You don't need a law to create an organizational culture of respect.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/127987_Bullying_Webinar_Blog_header_640x340.png" /></div><p><em>"I didn't know that was a thing,"</em> my friend responded when I told her I was publishing a book on international workplace bullying laws. Her comment voiced a common misconception that bullying is a schoolyard issue, not something that happens to adults in the workplace. </p>
<h3><strong>Workplace Bullying Is a Thing - And Very Much So</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.redbookmag.com/life/money-career/a22996449/what-is-workplace-bullying/">In 2017, 30 million American workers were targets of bullying</a>. In fact, a University of Illinois at Chicago study showed that workplace bullying is 2.5 to 3.5 times more common in workplaces than sexual harassment, its close counterpart.  The mental health impact from bullying has been found to be worse as well.</p>
<p>So, what is workplace bullying and what isn't? Workplace bullying is cumulative and repeated conduct which may include:</p>
<ul><li>accusing falsely for mistakes</li><li>screaming</li><li>excluding</li><li>intimidating non-verbal behaviors</li><li>sabotaging and defaming (often behind the back)</li><li>using put-downs</li><li>insulting and criticizing harshly</li><li>withholding resources and information necessary to the job</li><li>demanding an unreasonably heavy workload</li></ul>
<p>Workplace bullying is not everyday disagreements and 'dust-ups' in the office, someone having a bad day and losing his/her temper, reasonable instructions, or a tough performance review.</p>
<p>It is not discrimination: it is not based on being in a protected class such as race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, or disability. </p>
<h3><strong>Bullying Damages The Working Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Workplaces where bullying is allowed to occur undermine and harm the organization and those who work for it. Employer and organization costs may include those from litigation, increased staff absenteeism, turnover, loss of morale, reduced productivity, increases in health care and disability costs, early retirement and counseling program costs, and harm to the company's reputation.</p>
<p>Exposure to bullying may have severe health consequences for those involved, manifesting as somatic symptoms, anxiety, and depression. A targeted employee may experience a wide range of physical and psychological symptoms. In the most severe cases, workplace bullying may even result in suicide.</p>
<p>Damage can be even more far reaching. Research has shown that an employee who witnesses the bullying of others can have a stronger urge to quit their job than those who experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise that workplace bullying is increasingly a concern for management, ethics and compliance professionals, human resources personnel, attorneys, occupational health and safety representatives, as well as employees and employee groups. </p>
<h3><strong>Workplace Bullying Is Not Legally Actionable</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Surprisingly, <strong>workplace bullying is generally not illegal in the United States.</strong> If an employee is being repeatedly and severely harassed at work, and not because of race, age, gender, religion, or disability, there is no law to protect him/her or to deter a supervisor or co-worker's abusive conduct.</p>
<p>Governments, employers, and employees around the world are often surprised and perplexed by the lack of United States bullying prohibitions. Numerous countries view the employer's duty of care to ensure persons in the workplace are both psychologically and physically safe at work. This requirement has been interpreted to include a workplace free of bullying by countries such as Sweden, France, The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Australia, Canada, and Colombia. Provisions are often included as part of occupational health and safety laws and regulations, requiring an employer to protect a worker's psychological health and safety as well as his/her physical circumstances. Global laws may use different terms, such as victimization, moral harassment, or psychological harassment. Regardless, their message is the same: severe abusive conduct in the workplace is not acceptable.</p>
<p>There is some movement in the United States to prohibit bullying in the workplace. The <a href="http://healthyworkplacebill.org/">Healthy Workplace Bill</a>, to legislate against bullying, has been introduced in 30 states and 2 territories and moves closer to passage each year.   </p>
<h3><strong>What Can You Do, Then?</strong>  </h3>
<p><strong>You don't need a law to create an organizational culture of respect.</strong> A company policy against workplace bullying can go a long way to temper abusive conduct. The policy should have clear definitions and examples, training of employees and management, a confidential complaint procedure, impartial investigation process, and resolution protocol. Importantly, buy-in at the top has been shown to be key to changing workplace culture, and prohibiting bullying is no exception.</p>

It&#39;s arguably the more disruptive of the two cybersecurity laws.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text"> Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, organizations have been constantly striving to improve efficiency. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was the mechanization of manufacturing that revolutionized industry. Today, it’s the rise of digital technology.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Blog%20Post%20-%20Risk%20Ethics%20-%20AIRLINE%20EMEA%20BLOG.png" /></div><p>What happens when the network and information systems of an organization that supports essential services, such as the provision of healthcare, are compromised by a cyberattack? Any breakdown in their reliability and security will not only require a robust disaster recovery and business continuity strategy, but it will also have a detrimental impact on society.<br /><br /><strong>Implementing Technological Solutions: More Pros than Cons? Or Vice Versa?</strong><br />
As digital technology has developed, businesses and society have become increasingly reliant on network and information systems to facilitate everything from processing data to the supply of energy and water. This presents opportunities for organizations to streamline their operations, increase their competitive edge, and reduce their costs by implementing new technological solutions. <br /><br />
Adopting an innovative approach can, however, expose them to risks that have the potential to cause financial and reputational damage. For example, with such large volumes of digital data being processed daily, cyberattacks are a real threat - a vulnerability that can also harm the owners of the compromised data.<br /><br /><strong>NIS, the EU Information Directive Eclipsed by GDPR</strong><br />
Mindful that cyberattacks are on the increase, the European Union (EU) has been busy developing a piece of legislation designed to strengthen its members' cyber defenses. The EU's <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive" title="Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS)">Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS)</a> came into force in the United Kingdom (UK) in May 2018 - the same month the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was imposed. Consequently, NIS rather slipped under the radar as GDPR attracted largescale media coverage due to its wide-reaching scope.<br /><br />
NIS applies to organizations in the UK that are operators of essential services (OES). However, because NIS relates to loss of services rather than loss of data, it's arguably the more disruptive of the two new cybersecurity laws. <br /><br /></p>
<blockquote><p>The organization understands and manages security risks to networks and information systems supporting the delivery of essential services that arise from dependencies on external suppliers. This includes ensuring that appropriate measures are employed where third-party services are used.</p></blockquote>
<p>With such critical aspects of society impacted, the NIS directive deserves the same level of attention and consideration as GDPR. The ramifications of an attack on any one of these OESs is unimaginable to most of the general population, who would be the ones affected. <br /><br /><strong>What An Is OES and Why Compliance With NIS Is So Important </strong><br />
An OES is a public or private organization operating in the water, energy, transport, health, or digital infrastructure sector. The NIS Directive has been created to ensure organizations that operate in these critical sectors are prepared to cope with the growing number of cyber threats targeted on these sectors. Incidents that compromise network and information systems in any of these sectors have the potential to damage the UK's infrastructure and economy, and even put lives at risk. An attack on the UK's infrastructure is a very real possibility, as demonstrated by the <a href="http://theconversation.com/cyberattack-on-ukraine-grid-heres-how-it-worked-and-perhaps-why-it-was-done-52802" title="2015 attack on Ukraine's electricity network">2015 attack on Ukraine's electricity network</a>, leaving almost a quarter of million people without power. <br /><br />
Any OES that falls under the NIS Directive must meet four core objectives: <br />
• managing security risk; <br />
• defending systems against cyberattacks; <br />
• detecting cybersecurity events; and <br />
• minimizing the impact of cybersecurity incidents. <br /><br />
Organizations that fail to implement effective cybersecurity measures, as outlined by NIS, could face a fine of up to £17 million, or 4 percent of revenue - whichever is greater.<br /><br />
The financial damage caused by non-compliance with NIS shouldn't be an OES's only concern. Reputation is priceless. If customers don't think an organization is taking cybersecurity seriously, customers very likely won't trust the organizations, and will take their business elsewhere.<br /><br /><strong>Third-party Risk Management and NIS: Asset or Weakest Link?  </strong><br />
The drive to improve profitability and streamline operations motivates many organizations to outsource business functions that rely on technology. While third-party service providers don't fall within the scope of NIS, it's the responsibility of the OES to ensure suppliers have appropriate cybersecurity measures in place. Article 19 of the Directive states that:</p>
<p>Put another way, organizations are only as strong as their weakest link. With this in mind, OESs should incorporate a comprehensive third-party cyber resilience program into their strategy for achieving NIS compliance, including:<br /><br />
• Contractual terms of all third-party suppliers: review and record who currently has access to relevant systems and data, together with the level of access. Ensure all existing and new supplier agreements make provisions for cybersecurity. <br />
• Robust (and tested) cybersecurity measures: conduct regular risk assessments of the entire supplier base, and evaluation of security controls deployed by third-party tech suppliers.<br />
• Proactive and preventative measures designed to monitor networks and information systems: pre-assess the suitability of any potential third-party technology suppliers.<br />
• Automated tools: systems and processes that enable incidents and data breaches to be reported efficiently and effectively. <br /><br />
If the NIS Directive is to achieve its objective, OESs must recognize the importance of cybersecurity, both in terms of the benefits to their business and society in general. An informed approach to the issues in question will ensure NIS is viewed as a progressive measure rather than a regulator chore. By embracing the four core objectives organizations won't only be protecting their own interests, but they will also contribute to the reliability and security of the national infrastructure. Clearly, the NIS directive deserves the same level of attention and consideration as GDPR. <br /><br />
The good news is there are options with respect to your best way to approach compliance with NIS. You can work with an experienced provider like SAI Global and get advice you can trust and a solution that is out of the box. <br /><br />

Delaware has also recently released new laws on the same topic. Below, we review the specifics of those requirements, answer frequently asked questions we've received, and detail the ethics and compliance learning content developed by SAI Global <strong><a href="https://m.comms.saiglobal.com/webApp/APP1527" title="to ensure you can meet those requirements">to ensure you can meet those requirements</a></strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>LEGAL UPDATES</strong></h3>
<h4><em><strong>New York State</strong></em></h4>
<p>The new State law mandates that employers have written sexual harassment prevention policies and provide sexual harassment prevention training to all New York employees. The training requirements take effect on October 9, 2018 and all employees must be trained by October 9, 2019. Every employee must also receive training on an annual basis thereafter (or more frequently).</p>
<p>On August 24, 2018, the State of New York issued proposed model policies and model training documents, inviting comments from the public on each through September 12, 2018. These documents will be finalized after the comment period. This process is under way. New employees should complete sexual harassment prevention training as quickly as possible, ideally within approximately 30 days. The exact time period has yet to be specified.<br /><br /></p>
<h4><strong><em>New York City</em></strong></h4>
<p>The city law, which applies to employers with 15 or more employees, mandates that those employers conduct annual anti-sexual harassment training for all full-time and part-time New York City employees who work more than 80 hours in a calendar year.  The law takes effect on April 1, 2019 and all employees must be trained by September 1, 2019.  Like the State law, the city law employees must also be trained on an annual basis thereafter.</p>

<h4><strong><em>Delaware</em></strong></h4>
<p>Delaware's sexual harassment training requirements will apply to employers with 50 or more employees in Delaware (not including applicants and independent contractors) and will become effective January 1, 2019. <br /><br />
Under the new State law, Delaware employers must provide training: (1) for existing employees within one year of the effective date of the law (that is, by January 1, 2020); (2) for new supervisors within one year of the commencement of their employment in a supervisory role; and (3) for new employees within one year of their start date.  <br /><br />
The employee and supervisor training programs must be repeated every two years. The supplemental supervisor training must cover the specific responsibilities of a supervisor in preventing and correcting sexual harassment, as well as the legal prohibition against retaliation.

<h3><strong>SAI GLOBAL LEARNING CONTENT UPDATE  </strong></h3>
<p>The SAI Global content team has used these drafts to prepare addenda to existing courses covering those few issues that are not already addressed in our existing course materials, such as where a New York or Delaware employee would go to file a harassment complaint. These courses already meet the requirements of California AB 1825 and other states. This training is modern, mobile, translated, flexible, customizable, and <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/sexual_harassment_training_in_2018__how_we_create_legal__modern__and_engaging_content/" title="created in collaboration with legal experts at Quarles &amp; Brady LLP">created in collaboration with legal experts at Quarles &amp; Brady LLP</a>.</p>
<p>The additions to our existing courses with pages relevant to the New York laws will be released October 9, 2018. Once the laws are finalized (including any changes to the New York State law made as a result of the review of public comments), SAI Global will release light updates to reflect any changes, likely in early 2019.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/NY%20Harassment%20Profiling.png" /></div><h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Do we really need to train New York employees by January 1, 2019? </strong></p>
<p>No. The New York State law was recently updated with a deadline to train all New York employees by October 9, 2019. Note that following the close of the public comment period, this deadline was moved from January 1, which was previously listed as the deadline.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What is 'interactive' training? </strong></p>
<p>Both the New York State and City laws require “interactive” sexual harassment training.  “Interactive” training requires some form of employee participation. An employer's sexual harassment training may be web-based, but should include questions asked of employees and an opportunity for employees to ask and have their questions answered.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Is there a length of time requirement for the New York training? </strong></p>
<p>Neither the State nor the City have yet provided guidance on how long training must be.  <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>How often must New York employees receive sexual harassment training? </strong></p>
<p>Under the State law, all new employees must complete sexual harassment training within 30 calendar days of starting their job.  In addition, all employees must be trained at least once per year. In subsequent years, this may be based on the calendar year, anniversary of each employee's start date or any other date the employer chooses.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What if a New York employee only works part-time? </strong></p>
<p>Under the State law, employers are required to ensure that all employees receive training. Under the City law, employers are required to ensure that all employees who work more than 80 hours in a calendar year in New York City receive training.<br /><br /><br /></p>

SAI Global discusses the implications of increasing cyber-attacks.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">When the first commercial airline took flight, piloted by Tony Jannus, in 1914, 3,000 people gathered at the pier in St. Petersburg, Florida to watch in awe. The flight only last 23 minutes and it’s fair to assume that Abram C. Pheil, who was a passenger on board, probably wasn’t worried about his luggage being lost, subpar food, or that his personal data would be threatened.    </p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Blog%20Post%20-%20Risk%20Ethics%20-%20AIRLINE%20EMEA%20BLOG%20(3).png" /></div><p>Fast-forward to 2018 and passenger planes are not the only thing in the clouds. We have become increasingly reliant on the convenience that internet connectivity brings. Unfortunately, demand for speed and ease of online booking has come at a price for some airline passengers and the carriers they trusted with their personal data. </p>
<h3><br /><strong>Might as well place your data on the baggage carousel</strong></h3>
<p>British Airways (BA) has been <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=%22british%20airways%22%20data%20breach&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen" title="making headlines">making headlines</a> after the airline suffered a malicious breach of its website and mobile app. Around 380,000 payment cards - including the three-digit CVV security code on the back of cards - were compromised during the cyber-attack over a two-week period between 21 August and 5 September 2018. Confusion among BA customers was further compounded by news that the data was almost certainly being traded on the dark web immediately after the attack. <br /><br />
As recently as June - a month after the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force - members of BA's frequent flyer programme received an email reassuring them that: “Your personal information is in safe hands with British Airways. We want you to know you can trust us to respect your privacy and keep your personal information safe.”<br /><br />
The BA cyber-attack is not an isolated incident within the airline industry. In fact, it's just the latest in a growing list of data breaches to be reported:</p>
<ul><li>Air Canada recently confirmed a data breach - including passport details - of its mobile app between 22-24 August 2018, affecting up to 20,000 of its customers. </li><li>In July 2018 it was revealed that a major vulnerability in Thomas Cook Airlines' booking system had exposed the names, email addresses and flight details of customers.</li><li>In May 2018, Atlanta-based carrier Delta Airlines announced that its third-party online chat service had been impacted by a cyber incident between September and October 2017, resulting in customer payment information being compromised. </li><li>In 2016, Korea's second largest airline, Asiana Airlines, confirmed that its website had suffered a security breach, compromising the sensitive information of thousands of its passengers, including passport information, home addresses, bank account details and phone numbers.</li></ul>
<p>So, what are the implications of a cyber-attack and subsequent theft of personal data to both the airlines and their customers?</p>
<h3><strong>Sky's the Limit to Your Reputational Damage</strong></h3>
<p>Organisations receive and store vast amounts of personal data, bringing the issue of consumer trust to the fore. Established companies like BA build trust over time via proven track records. According to SAI Global's <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-gb/consumer_trust_index/" title="Consumer Trust Index (CTI)">Consumer Trust Index (CTI)</a>, a good reputation - even in the absence of direct experience with a company - equated to trust for 76% of consumers.<br /><br />
 Hard-earned trust can be fragile, however, even for a company of BA's stature. Particularly when it comes to a private data breach, potentially resulting in identity theft. The CTI reveals that 43% of consumers indicated they would never return to a company if their data had been breached. Put another way, imagine two out of every five customers taking their business elsewhere because of a cyber-attack that could have been avoided. </p>
<h3><strong>The real reason behind increased baggage fees</strong></h3>
<p>BA could face a hefty fine if found negligent for its handling of the incident. Under GDPR, companies are required to take precautions to protect customer data and notify the relevant authorities of any breaches within 72 hours. If it can be demonstrated that BA didn't do enough to protect the data in question, it could face a fine of up to four per cent of its annual revenue - the airline's total revenue in 2017 was £12.2billion, meaning it could be forced to shell out around £500 million. In addition, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/09/09/british-airways-customers-claim-data-distress/" title="estimates from legal experts">estimates from legal experts</a> suggest those impacted by the breach could claim up to £1,250 in compensation from BA.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding the reputational and financial mayday call</strong></h3>
<p>By implementing a robust risk management framework, an organisation will provide itself with a solid foundation for avoiding a crisis in the first place, and a better framework for managing one if and when it occurs. This helps the organisation reduce reputational and financial damage. According to the CTI, 47% of consumers agree strongly that trust can be regained by taking responsibility for the issue, ensuring it isn't repeated and providing ongoing high-quality service. Further, 44% of consumers strongly agree that taking time to understand the cause of the issue can regain their trust, and 36% strongly agreed that compensation for the issue can regain their trust.<br /><br />
 The provision of clear information to those affected about what happened and the steps they should take to protect themselves is essential in the immediate aftermath of a data breach. Having apologized, BA was quick to explain the nature of the breach and advise concerned customers to contact their banks or credit card providers and follow their advice. Before confirming the issue had been resolved, BA had notified the police and relevant authorities. In terms of financial compensation, BA chief executive Álex Cruz was at pains to stress that “We will work with any customer affected and we will compensate any financial hardship suffered.”</p>
<p>Companies must take data security seriously to ensure ongoing viability. The most effective means of preventing reputational and financial damage is adopting a proactive approach to cybersecurity detection and response. By stopping data breaches from occurring in the first place, consumer trust in the brand will be protected. And when a cyber-attack does occur, the speed and efficiency of the response is crucial.</p>

It’s time to work together to end this crisis.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">With a reported 800 million people worldwide suffering from either chronic malnutrition or hunger, it’s time for organizations, industry, governments, and consumers to work together to end this humanitarian crisis.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/CRSV2-129296%20World%20Food%20Day_LinkedIn_1200x627.jpg" /></div><p>On December 10, 1964 social activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. commented during his acceptance speech for the award of his Nobel Peace Prize, that he had “the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.”</p>
<p>Fast forward some 50 years, the issue of chronic hunger or malnutrition is still very much rife within global societies and has in fact been on the rise since 2014. According to <a href="http://www.fao.org/about/en/">The Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO)'s <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/I9553EN/i9553en.pdf">2018 State of Food Security and Nutrition Report</a>, a staggering 800 million people are reportedly suffering from chronic hunger or malnutrition; that's equivalent to one person in nine.</p>
<p>This social injustice is not exclusive to third-world countries. Figures from UK charity <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org">Trussel Trust</a> show that from 1st April 2017 to 31st March 2018, just over 1.3 million three-day emergency food supplies were delivered to people in crisis across the UK - a 13% increase on last year. And according to a new report by the Food Research &amp; Action Center, <a href="http://www.frac.org/research/resource-library/hungry-america-fracs-national-state-local-index-food-hardship-july-2018">“How Hungry is America?”</a>, after several years of decline, the national food hardship rate for all households in the US increased from 15.1% in 2016 to 15.7% in 2017.</p>
<p>What is shocking about this situation is that we do indeed have enough food on this planet to feed everyone but nearly a third of all food produced is lost or wasted. Food losses and waste amount to roughly US $680 billion in industrialized countries and US $310 billion in developing countries, or nearly US $1 trillion in total.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">It is estimated that around 40% of production can be lost before a product ever reaches the market. </h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<h3>Action on Food Waste</h3>
<p>From farm to table to boardroom, the scourge of hunger is a shared global problem that no one individual, organization or industry can solve. Ahead of us are numerous interconnected global challenges, as food loss and waste amount to a major squandering of resources. These include water, land, energy, labor and capital, and needlessly produce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), contributing to global warming and climate change. But we can solve it, together.</p>

<p>Reducing food waste and loss is a major part of the solution. Food waste happens throughout the entire food supply chain from field to fridge. Inefficiencies and bureaucracy in the food system result in:</p>
<ul><li>crops being tilled under and lost in the production process;</li><li><p>managerial and antiquated agricultural harvesting techniques mean other crops are overproduced;</p></li><li><p>retailers that have overabundance built into operation models;</p></li><li><p>lack of an ethical and well-managed vendor supply chain; and</p></li><li><p>behaviors of consumers, who have a huge part to play - individual consumers who buy food with the best intentions, only to have it sitting there spoiling in the back of the refrigerator way after it's use-by date.  </p></li></ul>
<p>To help to reduce the amount of food and waste, organizations should look to strengthen the supply chain through the direct support of farmers and investments in infrastructure, transportation, harvesting, cooling and packaging methods. As well as improving communication between producers and consumers to manage the supply chain more efficiently.</p>
<p>Beyond improving losses of crops on farms due to poor practices, doing more to better balance production with demand would mean not using natural resources to produce unneeded food in the first place. </p>
<h3>Food Waste and Climate Change</h3>
<p>Aside from the social, economic, and moral implications of food waste, the environmental cost of producing all that food, for nothing, is staggering.</p>
<p>Reducing food waste is one of the most important things we can do to tackle climate change. The energy that goes into the production, harvesting, transporting, and packaging of wasted food generates 7% of all global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), more than 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).</p>
<p>UK-based charity <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/benefits-reducing-global-food-waste">WRAP</a> estimates that by 2030 global GHGs could be lowered by at least 0.2 billion tons and possibly as much as 1 billion tons CO2 per year through food waste reductions, which it states is more than the annual emissions of Germany.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, look at all the metal cans, plastic bags and cardboard boxes our food comes in. By throwing away half a mac and cheese, half of the emissions that resulted from producing and processing, packaging, shipping, storing, picking up and cooking are also wasted.</p>
<p>In addition, we need to consider the amount of water wastage. Farming uses 70% of our freshwater; what's more, <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/196220/icode/">according to a UN report</a>, food that is produced but not eaten guzzles up a volume of water equivalent to the annual flow of Europe's largest river, Russia's Volga River.</p>
<p>Reducing food wastage represents one of the greatest possibilities for consumers, organizations and governments to contribute to reversing global warming, increase economic benefits and preserve threatened ecosystems, and at the same time take a little step closer to realizing Dr. King's belief - feeding everyone.</p>
<h3>Know to Grow, Grow to Know</h3>
<p>Whether it's industry, retailers, consumers, or governments we can all play our part and do better when it comes to decreasing food wastage.</p>
<p>For governments and organizations alike, they can enact food safety standards where they don't exist - jump-starting a system to properly transport and store perishable foods, ensuring that more food is safe for consumption. The food industry needs to look at implementing and formalizing an approach to food traceability and total transparency with its suppliers. By introducing vendor risk management solutions as part of a strategic approach to risk management, an organization can significantly reduce the risk that third parties introduce into its business.</p>
<p>The industry also needs to leverage innovative and scalable technologies not just within food production but also by implementing emissions management software as part of a robust environmental health and safety program. And through the use of learning management systems, we can introduce education programs to raise awareness of the impacts of food wastage both internally and externally.</p>
<p>And then there is us - the consumers. Each and everyone of us can take small steps that ultimately accumulate to make a meaningful difference. First step being for us to stop buying too much and throwing away the excess. A small change, but yet one that will yield big results.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/09/448652">FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva</a> commented: “All of us - farmers and fishers; food processors and supermarkets; local and national governments; individual consumers - must make changes at every link of the human food chain to prevent food wastage from happening in the first place, and re-use or recycle it when we can't.</p>
<p>We simply cannot allow one-third of all the food we produce to go to waste or be lost because of inappropriate practices, when 800 million people go hungry every day,” he added.</p>

Learn how to spot it, the effects, and what you can do to address it.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/129505%20Office%20Space%20Bullying%20_Blog_header_640x340.jpg" /></div><p>Another day at the office. Is it joy or dread? If you've seen the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Office Space,</a> a cult parody of everyday corporate life, you know what I'm talking about. Is there a Bill Lumbergh in your work life? if you are dealing with a boss or colleague who, with repeated smarmy callousness, makes your workday as unbearable as it can get, it isn't uncommon.</p>
<p>According to recent <a href="http://www.workplacebullying.org/wbiresearch/wbi-2017-survey/">statistics</a>, one in five Americans are bullied at work, and as many witness bullying in the workplace. It's an abusive behavior that currently affects 60 million people in the U.S., and is mostly carried out by people in supervisory and/or managerial positions who inflict misery on their direct reports. Workplace bullying refers to a <em>type</em> of unethical conduct, and is <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Bullying-and-Harassment-in-the-Workplace-Developments-in-Theory-Research/Einarsen-Hoel-Zapf-Cooper/p/book/9781439804896" title="defined">defined</a> in a fairly specific manner: “harassing, offending, socially excluding someone or negatively affecting someone's work tasks…repeatedly and regularly.”</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Workplace bullying is mostly carried out by individuals in supervisory and/or managerial positions who abuse their power and inflict misery on their direct reports.</h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>Below you can learn how to spot bullying behavior before it becomes an issue, understand the effects, and what you can do to address workplace bullying. Because nobody wants to be the next Lumbergh.</p>
<h3><strong>Deconstructing the Bullying Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>There are two characteristics that are key to understanding whether bullying is happening to you or others in your work environment: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">1) The negative behavior must occur more than once. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">2) The parties in conflict are not of equal strength-one has more power than the other, either because of his/her status, physical strength, social influence, or similar.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Do you remember that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsayg_S4pJg&amp;feature=youtu.be">scene</a> from Office Space when, after reluctantly complying with repeated requests of moving his workstation, Milton ends up in a super-cramped cubicle but is told by Lumbergh that he must move to the basement? And when he moves his desk to the squalid, dingy, poorly lit company basement, he is told by Lumbergh that now is a good opportunity for him to work on the cockroach problem? That is what bullying is about. You don't have to be actually sent to the basement, but bullying is when somebody is metaphorically doing that to you. They are belittling you and slowly diminishing the type of contribution you were hired to make. Even when the bullying is not so openly diminutive, it can still kill an employee's motivation and passion for his/her work.</p>

<h3><strong>'Office Space' Might be Fiction, but The Effects of Bullying Are Not</strong></h3>
<p>There are serious negative consequences for people on the receiving end of the bullying behavior, as well as for the organization where the bullying takes place. Forty percent of bullied targets experience adverse health effects. In addition, there is a strong correlation between bullying at work and </p>
<ul><li>intention to leave (i.e., the more vicious the bullying, the more the target wants to quit);</li><li>reduced focus and motivation at work;</li><li>decreased organizational commitment and satisfaction; and</li><li>workload stress resulting from negative relationships with colleagues.</li></ul>
<p>In fact, not only are the bullied likely to be persistently victimized, but they often have to put up with a work culture that is condoning the bullying, and, at times, even faulting the bullied targets for the bully's behavior. Still today, despite <a href="https://www.niot.org/stop-bullying-month-resources-2018?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6fvdBRCbARIsABGZ-vTTCpW9W-_ouzCHLsaU_kO8rzUdoKhl01BIh1Q9ggJ0ymdhIfRB_YcaAsBaEALw_wcB">public campaigns</a> to raise awareness on this issue, 71% of employer handling of bullying and 60% of coworker reactions remain averse to the targets. </p>
<p>As Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iiOEQOtBlQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">tells</a> the two Bobs who call him in to figure out how employees like him spend a typical workday at Initech, there is no point in doing more than fifteen minutes of actual work a week because nobody is going to recognize what he does.

<p><em><sup>Using a position of power to dictate office unnecessary office moves ... or, removing preferred office accessories ... may be a sign of workplace bullying.</sup></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<h3><strong>Grabbing the Bull(y) by the Horns</strong></h3>
<p>Bullying is real and costly. This is why it needs to be surfaced and corrected. There are three things organizations must do to deal with it head-on.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>1) Know It, Measure It</strong>. There are several effective measures to track bullying in the workplace. A particularly <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228079665_Measuring_exposure_to_bullying_and_harassment_at_work_Validity_factor_structure_and_psychometric_properties_of_the_Negative_Acts_Questionnaire-Revised" title="robust method">robust method</a> entails 21 items that focus on specific behaviors work bullies tend to engage in. For example, whether anyone is withholding information that is critical to the work of others, ignoring their opinion, ordering them to do work below their level of competence, assigning impossible deadlines, constantly criticizing them, etc. Measuring the occurrence of these behaviors on a regular basis would go a long way toward surfacing and sizing the problem - a critical first step to eradicate bullying at work. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>2) Create Safe Avenues for Speaking Out</strong>. It is difficult to report bullying behavior because one of the obvious risks is that the bully will retaliate against those who reported his/her conduct. This fear is often bolstered by the impression that employees have no real ally or support when the bullying is perpetrated by a manager. In such cases, a common belief is that both HR and management will act to cover things up and provide legal protection to the company, rather than address the issue and support the bullied targets.<br /><br />
The problem with this type of response is that it will make the organization's culture even more toxic and unethical - letting a bully go unaddressed means opening the door to more bullies. This is why companies should manage the costs and risks of bullying directly. Instead of sweeping things under the rug, they must create different channels employees can use to report any form of bullying they've directly experienced or witnessed. In particular, surveys, hotlines, and independent counselor are good approaches organizations can start putting in practice to support the bullied targets and stop abetting the bullies. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>3) Raise Awareness.</strong> This is where training plays a critical role by generating the type of understanding and awareness that oftentimes is lacking in the workplace. The behaviors that define bullying can be subtle, and they may be mistakenly viewed as a legitimate exercise of the power that comes with being in a certain role. This is why bullying is often left unaddressed and the bully finds a thousand accomplices around him/her. When it comes to education, though, it's critical to shed light not just on the behaviors, but also on the psychological mechanisms that lead bullies, victims, and bystanders to continue a vicious cycle of negative behavior.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No organization should discount bullying and its consequences. The costs are too many and too high. October is Bullying Prevention month, so if you read this, <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/risk/ethics_and_compliance/ " title="make sure to do something to raise awareness">make sure to do something to raise awareness</a> and help someone who may need it. </p>

<p><strong>How to Survive and Thrive in an Ever-Changing Business Landscape</strong></p>
<br />
<p>We recently conducted a webinar with tips on surviving and thriving in the current fast-changing and competitive business landscape. Below is a recap of what we covered, as well as a link to view the webinar recording.</p>
<p><strong>It Is About How We Respond To Change</strong></p>
<p>In 1963, Professor Leon Megginson noted that, according to Darwin's Origin of Species the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself is the species that survives. This observation holds true not only in the world of science, but also in the world of business. </p>
<p>We can learn change management by taking a course of study, but this takes diligence and time. Another way to short-cut the learning process is by taking some simple execution-focused actions.</p>
<p><strong>Action #1: Identify and Understand the Change that is Necessary</strong></p>
<p>We can only respond to what we know is changing within our business and industry. Staying up to date with regulatory developments is essential when it comes to identifying and understanding the required business change that is necessary. One way to stay up to date is to sign up for <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/media-centre/sign-up-for-media-release-alerts/">ASIC's media alerts service</a> for regulator's latest news. Other regulators such as the ACCC and the OAIC provide a similar free service. </p>
<p>Another useful resource is <a href="http://www.feefiefoefirm.com/au/">Fee Fie Foe Firm</a>. This is a handy engine for searching for law firm articles that covers the latest developments in case law, legislation, and industry practice.</p>
<p><strong>Action #2 - Managing The Risks of Change with the Help of Technology</strong></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://infostore.saiglobal.com/en-au/Standards/AS-NZS-ISO-31000-2009-119718_SAIG_AS_AS_274522/">new International Risk Management Standard</a>, <em>risk</em> is the 'effect of uncertainty on objectives', and 'risk management' means the 'coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.'</p>
<ul><li>Accept - We are aware of these risks and we can have controls in place to monitor them.</li><li>Reject - We consider these risks too high, so we will avoid those risks by not engaging in certain activities.</li><li>Transfer - We can transfer some risks to another party, such as through insurance cover.</li><li>Reduce - Some risks are identified and we can implement controls to reduce the risks, such as disclosure in the event of a conflict of interest.</li></ul>
<p><strong>In Case You Missed It</strong></p>
<p>To survive and thrive in this ever-changing landscape, we should master change by improving awareness, identifying and managing risks, treating risks appropriately, and utilising technology wisely.</p>

Discover Miyagi&#39;s 3 bully defenses and how to apply it.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">How the bullied can wrestle back control</p><p>There is a scene in Karate Kid that has all of us hanging by a thread: During the final tournament - the ultimate showdown between Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso - <em>sensei</em> instructs Johnny to <a href="https://youtu.be/Wd7PvbJece8">sweep Daniel's injured leg</a>. Johnny looks back at him with surprise. It's a fleeting moment, but for a split second there is real indecision in his eyes. We look at him, in hopes that he might say 'no,' but, instead, he nods along and complies. This iconic scene raises an important question: <strong>how likely is a bully to do the right thing?</strong></p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/KarateKid_sweep_the_leg.png" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://youtu.be/Wd7PvbJece8?t=51"><sup>"Karate Kid - sweep the leg" on YouTube</sup></a></em></p>
<p>In my experience studying behavioral psychology, ethics, and organizational culture, it is important to take into account the bully's actual psychological profile. Bullies often possess some combination of <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0038929.pdf">unsavory traits</a>, including: </p>
<ul><li>a callous-unemotional orientation;</li><li>psychopathic tendencies;</li><li>aggressive behaviors;</li><li>conduct problems;</li><li>anti-social personality traits; and</li><li>susceptibility to peer pressure, anxiety, and/or depression.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This is why they are unlikely to feel compelled by shared social norms and do what is right.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>It's About the Bully's Hubris</strong></h3>
<p>One thing that is often misattributed to bullies is low self-esteem. But, in fact, it's quite the opposite: bullies attack others to keep their self-esteem high-they feel hubris, or even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19037950">narcissistic pride</a>, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to protect their egotistical sense of self-importance. Thus, if somebody who is likeable, competent, or otherwise possesses some other trait that the bully lacks threatens the bully's social standing, that person must pay a price. Wearing his skeleton Halloween costume, Johnny cannot stop beating Daniel up; when his friends tell him to give it a rest, he has no qualms: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1DmdgOdHgw&amp;feature=youtu.be">enemies deserve no mercy</a>.” </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/KarateKid_no_mercy.png" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1DmdgOdHgw&amp;feature=youtu.be"><sup>"Karate Kid halloween fight (1984)" on YouTube</sup></a></em></p>
<p>The bullied target has done nothing to deserve the bully's treatment. In “Karate Kid”, Daniel spending time with Ali (Johnny's ex-girlfriend) and other friends on the <a href="https://youtu.be/vERIDDbMcfk">beach</a> is a good metaphor for this behavior. Ali and Johnny are already ancient history, as one of Johnny's friends is quick to note; yet, Johnny cannot stand the fact that Ali is hanging out with Daniel. That feels like a personal affront to him.   </p>
<p>Bring this scenario into the workplace: imagine that you've just been hired for a role that requires unique technical competencies. Your boss has a much bigger job than yours, but s/he doesn't have your expertise and feels threatened by your technical competence. You are doing nothing wrong, just your job as well as you can-what you were hired for-but, in your boss's eye, you are lessening his/her social standing. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The One-Two Punch: Inflicting Harm, Manipulating Others</strong></h3>
<p>The bully's behavior and emotional reactions are primitive, but the twisted conduct s/he will likely engage in can be exceptionally effective. For example, it's been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5lvyopCAr4">noted</a> that bullies use overt or covert terror not only to crash their target/s but also to silence those around them. At the same time, bullies know how to use their power to win the loyalty of other team members. They can display a charming and altruistic side at the right time, using resources to help non-threatening colleagues. This has a two-fold effect: </p>
<ul><li>On the one hand, it is another way for the bully to express egotistical pride and demonstrate his/her superior social status-the bully proves s/he has the resources and influence that go with his/her puffed-up higher standing in the group.   </li></ul>
<ul><li>On the other hand, the bully's selective kindness is enough to confuse those who are not targeted by him/her. Unlike the colleagues who've been bullied, the beneficiaries of the bully's 'niceness' can bask in the bully's higher status and feel special themselves. This explains why bullying is often framed as a form of conflict rather than as outright abuse.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Such common rationalization is an attempt to explain away the bully's behavior without questioning one's bystander role. In fact, if the bullied target tries to stand up for himself/herself, s/he will likely be viewed as someone craving social conflict.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Miyagi's Three Hidden Bully Defenses</strong></h3>
<p>While bullied targets must be careful, given the bully's vicious mindset, they must also find ways to stand up to their tormentor. Not only will that help reduce the damages that the bullying is likely to inflict on the target's emotional well-being, but it is also necessary to contain the bully's conduct.</p>
<p>Bullies can be quite <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105314523303?journalCode=hpqa">impulsive</a> and they lack <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1001.5417&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">self-control</a>. If left unleashed, they will likely continue to pick on their victims. So, how should the bullied manage the bully and protect themselves? Learning from Miyagi's teachings to Daniel, there are three moves of mental strength bullied targets need to master to overcome the bully's outer power. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMCsXl9SGgY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Wax On, Wax Off</a>. Remember when Miyagi asks Daniel to complete several 'grunt work tasks when they meet each other? The unforgettable car washing scene, where Miyagi gives him specific instructions: “Wax on, right side; wax off, left side.” It's indelible. And that is the first practice the bullied target needs to engage in. S/he must remember what his/her fundamental strengths are. Instead of viewing these strengths as common and menial-similar to how the act of waxing on and waxing off might feel on the surface-the bullied target must reconnect with them, recognize how unique they are, and continue practicing them. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNDC0MZOlEI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Learn the Punch</a>. When Miyagi teaches Daniel how to punch, he says “the secret to punch…make power; whole body fitting inside one inch…” That's the second lesson the bullied target must learn. S/he must bring his/her whole self to the punch, not just his/her disgust and aversion for the bully, but his/her heart and compassion. While bullies should never be excused, bullied targets must learn to look at their tormentors with compassion. That will help them see the shame that plagues the mind of the bully, creating a path to overcome the sense of control the bully is trying to exercise over them</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/KarateKid_punch.png" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNDC0MZOlEI"><sup>"The Karate Kid (1984) - Learning The Punch" on YouTube</sup></a></em></p>

<p style="padding-left: 20px;">3. <a href="https://youtu.be/WCenGKkj3YQ">When It's Time, Use the Crane Kick</a>. There will be times of direct confrontation when the bullied target will likely stand in front of the bully injured and weakened, as Daniel continued to do in that final tournament fight, picking himself up again and again. In those moments, while the bully's power and the hurt of his/her abusive behavior may seem inescapable, the bullied target should never forget about his/her secret move- your own personal crane kick.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/KarateKid_crane_kick.png" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCenGKkj3YQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" title="The Crane Kick - The Karate Kid (8/8) Movie CLIP (1984) HD, on YouTube"><sup>The Crane Kick - The Karate Kid (8/8) Movie CLIP (1984) HD, on YouTube</sup></a></em></p>
<p>It is not the job of the bullied to fix the bully. If the culture in which the bullied person operates condones bullying, the bullied target must have an exit plan and eventually move on. The crane kick is not only about leaving a toxic environment behind yourself, physically and mentally, but also about never forgetting the lessons you've so painfully learned:   </p>
<ul><li>the importance of internal strength;</li><li>what genuine respect entails; and</li><li>how hard the work of respecting others truly is.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Bullying prevention month is almost over, but our commitment to creating a culture of deep respect must continue. If you know somebody who is being bullied, help them find their mentor/s. If you work in a toxic culture, <a href="https://www.ethics.org/press-release/employees-are-15-times-more-likely-to-do-the-right-thing-with-proactive-communication-from-leadership/ " title="speak up">speak up</a> and acknowledge what bullying entails and why your organization or team needs to connect with positive human qualities like compassion and empathy. Create self-awareness, and do not shortchange the benefits the right type of <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/risk/ethics_and_compliance/ " title="training and education">training and education</a> can bring about.</p>

Learn how SAI Global can make PPS registrations/searches easy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro-text">The Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) offers an easy way for businesses to protect themselves when transacting with customers, such as when buying, selling, leasing, or hiring out personal property. </p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/129672%20PPSR%20Renewal%20Blog%20Post_EmailBanner_600x270.jpg" /></div><p>The Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) is Australia's single, national, online register where details of security interests in personal property can be registered and searched. Personal property is defined as all forms of property other than real estate (subject to limited exceptions). The PPSR operates as a noticeboard and offers an easy way for businesses to protect themselves when transacting with customers, such as when buying, selling, leasing, or hiring out personal property. </p>
<h3><strong>PPSR Gives Protection Against Risks</strong></h3>
<p>For purchasers of equipment, a PPSR search can disclose whether the equipment is likely to be free from existing financed debt and therefore safe from possible repossession. Sellers and lessors can be protected too. When selling on retention of title or consignment, or hiring or leasing out personal property, making a registration on the PPSR can provide protection in the event that the customer does not pay. A properly registered security interest can have priority over any unregistered interests. This was the case in <em><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2013/852.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=queensland%20excavation%20services%20personal%20property">Maiden Civil</a></em>, where the NSW Supreme Court found that a registered security interest had priority over an unregistered interest, despite that the holder of the unregistered interest owned the goods, being three expensive construction vehicles.</p>
<p>The recent decision of <em><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/sa/SASCFC/2018/95.html">Samwise Holdings v Allied Distribution Finance</a></em> reminds secured parties of the importance of making a PPSR registration in a timely manner. In this case, the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of a lower court decision and affirmed the trial judge's interpretation of the legislation on how a “purchase money security interest” (<a href="https://www.ppsr.gov.au/pmsi-purchase-money-security-interest">PMSI</a>) should be registered. We covered this in an earlier <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/news_and_resources/industry_news/the_personal_property_securities_act_turns_6_on_30_january_2018/">blog</a>. In addition to timely registration, make sure your registration is valid. A defective registration can literally cost you millions. In <em><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2017/21.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=title(%222017%20NSWSC%2021%22)">OneSteel Manufacturing</a></em>, a leasing company had to forfeit $23 million in leased equipment to the administrators of OneSteel as it incorrectly registered its interest against OneSteel's ABN and not the ACN.</p>
<h3><strong>Renew Registrations Before They Expire to Ensure Protection is Continuous</strong></h3>
<p>The Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) is responsible for managing the application of personal property securities laws. According to AFCA's <a href="https://www.afsa.gov.au/statistics/commentary-june-quarter-2018-ppsr-quarterly-statistics">June quarter 2018 PPSR quarterly statistics</a>, most PPSR registrations have a duration of seven years (or less). This comes as no surprise, as (up until 31 July 2018 ) it only costs $6.80 to register a security interest for any period up to seven years. (The other two registration periods and costs are $34 for any period up to 25 years, and $119 for an indefinite period.) If you need to make PPSR registrations, SAI Global can help. You can find out more <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/Property/SearchServices/BusinessAndCommercialInformation/PPSR.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>In case you have not heard, most PPSR fees have gone <em>down</em> on 1 August 2018. It now costs only $6 to make a registration for up to seven years. You can find out more about the new fees <a href="https://www.ppsr.gov.au/blog-speeches/new-ppsr-fees-start-today">here</a>. It really does not cost much to get protected from risks!</p>
<p>In January 2019, when the PPSR will have been operating for seven years, AFSA reported that a staggering 118,422 registrations are due to expire. This is largely because a significant number of businesses registered their security interests on the PPSR when it first went live in January 2012. </p>
<p>Businesses should renew their registrations before they expire to make sure the protection afforded by the PPSR is continuous. This is known as “continuous perfection”, meaning that there have been no gaps in the “perfection” (that is, registration, in this context) of the security interest. A security interest that is perfected and continuously perfected generally will take priority over a security interest in the same property with a gap between renewals.</p>
<h3><strong>The PPSR in Practice</strong></h3>
<p>It has been <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-25/banking-royal-commission-live-blog/9905704">reported</a> that farm finance (e.g., agricultural business lending) is one of the flashpoints that saw several Nationals push hard for the Federal Government to conduct an inquiry into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry.  The importance of registration and continuous perfection can be illustrated with a farm finance example.</p>
<p>A secured party that operates in the agricultural space can benefit from an extra priority that applies to security interests taken when supplying goods that assist with the development of livestock or the growth of crops. A financier who takes a security interest when providing a farmer with goods (such as feed for cattle or fertiliser for soil) can benefit from an extra priority that applies. The proviso is that the livestock is acquired or the crops are planted within six months from entering into the agreement.</p>
<p>Put another way, agricultural suppliers get extra priority over other security interests in the resulting livestock or crop, provided that they register their interest and keep their interest registered.  This means perfection, and continuous perfection is a must!</p>
<h3><strong>How to Renew a Registration</strong></h3>
<p>A secured party (such as a lender or a supplier) can renew a registration by amending the duration of that registration. The end date for the registration can be extended any number of times. This must be done prior to the registration's expiry, and accompany a $6 fee (for a duration seven years or less). A comprehensive list of fees for using the PPSR can be found <a href="https://www.ppsr.gov.au/fees">here</a>.</p>
<p>A secured party can request a report of 'Registrations due to expire' from the 'Reports' tab of the PPSR's secured site. To access this report, make sure you have your access code of the relevant secured party group (SPG) handy, as well as the 'SPG number.'</p>
<h3><strong>The Time to Act is Now</strong></h3>
<p>Remember, ownership alone is not enough to protect a secured party. We explained this in an earlier <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-au/news_and_resources/industry_news/asset_protection_for_the_equipment_lessor_%E2%80%93_title_is_not_king_/">blog</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.ppsr.gov.au/why-use-ppsr">PPSR</a>: “The register offers your business excellent risk protection. It is also a tool that can help you raise finance using your business goods and assets” .Act now - conduct an audit to identify registrations that you need to renew. In addition, review all details to ensure correctness. Some parts of a PPSR registration can be amended, and you can consider making any necessary changes as you renew a registration. Examples of parts of a registration that can be amended include </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>grantors (add or remove);</li><li>free text description of the collateral;</li><li>whether the registration is subordinate to another registration; and</li><li>proceeds to be claimed.</li></ul>

And as today's climate of high-profile data breaches continues, the pressure is mounting for the teams to fend off these faceless antagonists. Leading the charge from the front is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).</p>
<p>With the spotlight shining on CISOs, we invited a group of leading information security professionals to take part in <a href="http://view.ceros.com/sai-global/finance-desktop/p/1">The Most Non-Annoying Survey for Chief Information Security Officers Survey</a>. We also had a chat with our very own CISO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-macarthur-king-06801524/">Peter Macarthur-King</a> - a veteran IT security professional with over three decades of experience - on a number of cyber-related issues.</p>
<p><strong>Q. The news has recently featured many data breaches related to third-party vendors. At what point does an organization need to step up their game and help protect a brand's reputation?</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter:</em> There isn't a point where you should think, “<em>When do I start?</em>” It's something you need to do from the get-go. If you wait, it could be too late when you find out, as we've already seen in 2018. It has its own tipping point as such, and for many, it's already tipped. Do <em>not</em> waste time. If you're not checking your vendors now, start <em>now</em>. And if you have new vendors? Start when you get them.  From day one. Current events need not be a reminder to suggest what to do or not to do. The threats and attacks are growing in size and frequency. The direction is clear: instill a culture of safety and protection as soon as you can.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q. Do you agree with the way some large enterprises like Apple, Facebook and Google are strengthening their defenses by hiring 'white hat' hackers to find system vulnerabilities and fix them?</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter:</em> It's a hotly debated topic whether an organization should hire a hacker and however bizarre and potentially unethical it may seem, 'white hat' hackers have become more well-known because of security-savvy organizations like Apple and Google. </p>
<p>The thing to remember is, technology is moving faster than our ability to secure it. In a world that is built on mobility and openness, tapping the collective wisdom of the hacker community can be an important tool in the security arsenal. So using white hat hackers may just work for your business, but you should seriously consider the pros and cons of hiring former hackers before making the leap of faith because it could literally be 'a leap of faith'. </p>
<p>That said, by embracing the diverse community of hackers and tapping into their passion, you can significantly reduce your risk profile, just as savvy Google, Apple and Facebook have.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, what I learned from companies hiring hackers is embrace the hacker mindset. Hackers probe and test with things to the point of breaking and question how operations work. By doing so, your security team can develop a stronger defense strategy that combines culture, process, and technology.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q. What experiences in your professional life have changed the way you handle your own business as an individual?</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter:</em> As a security person, it's common to get paranoid as you progress through your career. What I see today is less trust in cold calls. Now, when someone rings me up and says, "Hi, this is so-and-so," I simply don't believe them. I don't speak to anybody. I would never give any information to somebody who's cold-called. </p>
<p>And anecdotally, my bank is doing it. They say, “Hi, this is your bank. Could you please identify yourself?” And I used to do that. And then one day, I started saying, “No, <em>you</em> identify <em>your</em>self. Why should <em>I</em> tell you who <em>I</em> am? <em>You</em> tell me who <em>you</em> are.” I was belligerent for some time. Then one day, my bank rang me, and said, “Hi, this is the month you were born. This is where you live. Tell me the date of the month and the year, and we've identified each other.” </p>
<p>And I thought, bingo, <em>you've changed the behavior of the vendor</em> - in my case, my bank - to react to my fears. Behavior needs to change all around. We can't simply rely on the ways we used to do things. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>Q. Who are your friends in the operation? Who is your ally to get things done to maintain protection over the organization?</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter:</em> The guy who gets my coffee! Seriously though, it's management who is invested in what you're doing and is supportive in what you're attempting to achieve that makes a huge difference. A CISO can walk around and start poking at people, saying "Do this, do that, here's the policy …” And people will go, “yeah, yeah, yeah.” But if you've got management to whom you can escalate issues, who actually <em>act</em>, who <em>respond</em> to the requirement - one reminder is often enough.</p>
<p>So, constructive support and active support by management is very important, and that will be the number one path. Moreover, it's not a specific title. In ISO 27001 and in the SOC world, executive management plays a key role. These standards bodies have realized that one person running in the organization at mid-level management level doesn't really have the [full] authority to run the business. That's why top management needs to have some accountability.</p>

That metamorphosis can be attributed to: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">1. The growth of ethics and compliance as a function within organizations; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">2. The evolution of the employees consuming training experiences as part of their time spent working. </p>
<p>Both factors are <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/redefining_compliance_program_effectiveness_through_the_lens_of_learners/">driving a focus on a learner-centric approach</a> to ethics and compliance programs, which is perhaps most concisely defined as 'a strategy that's driven by your audience, their context and their needs.'</p>
<p>The six principles of <a href="https://www.elucidat.com/people-centered-elearning/">people-centered eLearning</a>, outlined below, align with conversations I've had with our clients around the world, research being published by our industry, and what was discussed during the October 2018 SCCE annual conference in Las Vegas.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/EA_image_01.jpg" /></div><p><sub>image source: Elucidat 'People-Centered Learning 2018 Report' <a href="https://www.elucidat.com/people-centered-elearning/">https://www.elucidat.com/people-centered-elearning/</a></sub></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This approach is considerably different from the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SAIGlobal/the-state-of-the-chief-compliance-officer-2018-sai-global-116579062">origins of corporate ethics and compliance</a>, just 28 years ago, built on a strategy of regulatory oversight, laws and punishment. This hasn't been pushed aside. Rather, the past three decades has taught us balance is essential in a program that is measurably effective. It is that universal alignment around the importance of the learner's experience and regulatory compliance principles that drove SAI Global's EthicsAnywhere philosophy around E&amp;C programs. This focus on the intersection of a learner-centric methodology and modern technology redefines what training and program effectiveness can look like. </p>
<h3><strong>An Expert POV: Good and Bad E&amp;C Training</strong></h3>
<p>In a new paper published by the eLearning Guild in 2018, <em><a href="https://www.elearningguild.com/publications/126/creating-compliance-training-learners-will-love/?from=content">Creating Compliance Training Learners Will Love</a></em>, ten experienced professionals, focused on compliance training and adult learning, share their insights and commentary on this topic. The 20-page piece is loaded with insights that boil down to a practical definition of what makes E&amp;C training good and bad in today's environment, and how the best training debunks the reputation E&amp;C has earned in the past and begins to change in the future. </p>
<ul><li><strong>'Bad' E&amp;C training is</strong> overly-focused on legal requirements, prioritizes information over scenarios, equates exposure to learning, overlooks importance of design, rewards memorization, and does not frame training through the context of the work people actually do.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>'Good' E&amp;C training</strong> relates to each learner, is applicable to challenges and scenarios they face, leverages original approaches to delivery and communication, and focuses on specific outcomes and goals.</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I don't know that it has to be splashy and flashy, but it has to hold interest and feel real in some way. What will somebody remember? You've got to engage, reinforce, retain.”<br />
 -Rashelle Tanner, <a href="https://www.elearningguild.com/publications/126/creating-compliance-training-learners-will-love/?from=content">Director of Compliance Training at Microsoft</a></em></p>
<p>What is considered 'bad' E&amp;C training today by this panel of experts was once considered good enough. However, expectations have evolved - and so have the people at the heart of them. </p>
<h3><strong>Modern Learners Need Modern Training</strong></h3>
<p>The evolution of the employee, effectively documented in a new viral infographic from marketing legend Larry Kim, is instrumental to unpack the evolution of the modern workplace, and as a result, modern ethics and compliance programs.</p>
<div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/EA_image_02a.jpg" /></div><p>While employees have traditionally been confined to the 9-5 workday, that's increasingly becoming the exception, not the rule. <em>When</em> we work is changing, and so is <em>where</em> we work, and how we accomplish our goals. Productivity and collaboration are no longer limited to a computer, desk, or office, thanks to the proliferation of connectivity and accessibility and portability of email and projects. How we learn and grow as individuals has improved, thanks to data and technology that understands who we are, what we know and what we need to know. </p>
<p>For ethics and compliance professionals, these changes are significant: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">1. If learners work anytime and work anywhere, their exposure to risk and situations where ethics and compliance violations occur are no longer confined to four office walls and the hours they're there. The majority of E&amp;C programs today are <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/why_responsive_design_and_accessibility_create_a_better_ethics_and_compliance_learning_experience/">not delivering content on mobile devices</a>, but every trend suggests making training and resources about risks available when they're needed, at the right time and place, is inevitable and necessary.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">2. If learners are constantly on the go, and time is being spent in different ways than in the past, how we spend our time with E&amp;C must adapt to those behavioral changes too.  Shorter E&amp;C training has been trending for years, and all signs point to that continuing, <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2018">because according to LinkedIn</a> and other researchers, the number one barrier for learners to consume new information is time.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">3. If learners are accustomed to deeply personalized and specific experiences in their lives, this expectation is bound to become embedded in interactions with ethics and compliance in the workplace. That level of personalization opens new doors to analysis and measurement, because a generic, 'one-size-fits-all' E&amp;C experience is likely to provide generic data about the effectiveness of an E&amp;C program too.</p>
<p>Research here, including the six principles of people-centered eLearning, identifies key trends that will change how each individual (and learner) in your organization accomplishes their goals. The tricky thing about trends is they're a lot like a wave - sometimes you're early to hop on and find yourself looking back, and sometimes you're late to notice and the reality of your decision crashes down on you. When you get the timing right, it can propel you forward with a rush of positive energy and momentum. For ethics and compliance professionals waiting for the right opportunity to modernize their program, the time is now. </p>

Compliance programs are becoming more important than ever in helping the fight to end this complex and ever-evolving phenomenon.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Corruption%20is%20the%20Dark%20Underbelly%20of%20the%20Corporate%20World2%20-%20SAI%20Global.png" /></div><p>Headlines tell tales of corruption cases that could have been lifted straight from the pages of an espionage thriller; from whistle-blowers receiving threatening night-time calls, to giant oil companies, ex-MI6 agents, and political officials embroiled in allegations of bribery.</p>
<p>Corruption is a global phenomenon, and remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The World Bank estimates that $1 trillion is paid in bribes while an <u><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/we-waste-2-trillion-a-year-on-corruption-here-are-four-better-ways-to-spend-that-money/">estimated $2.6 trillion</a></u> is stolen annually through corruption - a sum equivalent to more than five percent of the global GDP - and although the precise estimate is debatable, what isn't is the effect of corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption does not exist in a vacuum; its reach is deep and interconnected. In the corporate world, it is often associated or facilitated by transnational crimes such as money-laundering, human trafficking, trafficking narcotics, and trade of illicit animal products and arms. Politically, it represents an obstacle to democracy and the rule of law; economically it threatens a country's wealth, often diverting money to corrupt officials' pockets, and distorts fair market competition resulting in an uneven playing field where compliant companies are effectively excluded.</p>
<p>One of the pervasive elements of corruption is the architecture of the international financial system. Shell companies are a prime example of this. These legal entities are designed purely to protect real owners from disclosure, liability and accountability - the basis of corruption. Meanwhile, the trickle of money into tax havens has become a flood. The total being held in offshore banks is estimated to be a staggering ten percent of global GDP and rising.</p>
<p>The highly collusive and hidden nature of corruption makes tackling and preventing it complex; there is no silver bullet. But more must be done at the global level to cut red tape and close loopholes that facilitate the movement of the proceeds of corruption, money-laundering, and related crimes across jurisdictions.</p>

<p>In November 2018, the French bank <u><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-socgen/societe-generale-to-pay-1-4-billion-to-settle-cases-in-the-u-s-idUSKCN1NO26B">Société Générale</a></u> agreed to pay over $1.3 billion to settle U.S. and French charges that it bribed Libyan officials to obtain business. It was the first-ever coordinated bribery case between the two countries.</p>
<p>Many other countries have made significant progress in curbing corruption. What we are seeing now is the adoption and enhancement of anti-corruption laws and accountability regulation at an ever-increasing rate, and global enforcement is starting to catch up. New standards have been agreed into law that promote the fight against corruption and made bribery and corruption a prominent issue on corporate agendas. The recent enactment of laws and standards such as the UK Bribery Act, the EU business disclosure requirements for corporations, and the International Organization for Standardization's <u><a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-37001-anti-bribery-management.html">ISO 37001 standard</a></u>, which was designed to help organizations prevent and detect bribery, are cases in point.</p>
<p>And in the years since the US Treasury Department implemented “Section 311” of the USA Patriot Act, it has gone after the <u><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-chinese-banks-north-korea/u-s-treasury-targets-chinese-bank-over-purported-ties-to-north-korea-new-sanctions-risk-emerges-idUSKBN19S09B">banks and front companies</a></u> that help North Korea evade <u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/using-financial-sticks-to-control-iran/2015/08/27/62e1c51a-4b36-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html?utm_term=.e71faadd8efd">sanctions</a></u>, and used the Act to punish banks that helped <u><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js1874.aspx">Saddam Hussein</a></u> launder money, and put pressure on offshore havens, like the <u><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js194.aspx">Pacific island of Nauru</a></u>.</p>
<p>What's also changing is the level of consumer and stakeholder activism which has led to significant pressure on organizations to be more transparent. And with this increased public and regulatory appetite for openness, a steady stream of new accountability regulations has come into force. Regulations like the UK's Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR), the U.S.'s recently passed legislation - The Senior Safe Act - and Australia's Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR), are making sure firms take governance and individual responsibility seriously.</p>
<p>There's no arguing the fact that these laws and regulations have made, and will make, a contribution in the fight against corruption and continue to be important, but they are not enough to assure success. The corrupt have a way of beating the legal provisions and to run circles around legal institutions, in many cases evading justice. This is why business leaders, organizations and institutions need do their part to reshape the fight against corruption with a strategy that integrates the challenge of improving governance in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Ramping up efforts from enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute corruption as well as the increased pressure from consumers and shareholder activists has sharpened organizations' focus on having robust anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance programs in place. Whereas previously organizations viewed corruption policies and procedures as 'nice to have' but not 'essential', the review and implementation of programs and instilling a proper anti-corruption culture has not only been pushed up the corporate agenda but is also becoming the credo of  organizations.</p>
<p>Creating a culture that influences employees' actions, decision-making and behavior can be a challenging and lengthy process, requiring sensitivity, patience and resources. Corruption can be so ingrained into a company's culture as to be considered simply 'the way business is done'. As Tim Leissner, Goldman Sachs's former chairman of Southeast Asia, admitted in a plea that he bribed officials to get bond deals and said “a culture of secrecy” at the investment bank, led him to conceal wrongdoing from compliance staff. </p>
<blockquote><p>Anti-corruption compliance is not just a question of checking boxes and it shouldn’t happen only when things go wrong. Taking a proactive approach to compliance by putting in place strong controls and making anti-corruption compliance part of one’s corporate culture is the best way to prevent corrupt acts before they happen.</p><p>Angel Gurría</p><p>Secretary-General, OECD</p></blockquote><p>Fostering an open culture of disclosing wrongdoing in the workplace necessitates an integrated approach. Visible support from leadership should not be underestimated. If senior leadership declare a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, they must demonstrate they will support employees if they lose contracts or business in the short-term as a result. By creating a culture of integrity and openness - where ethical dilemmas arising from doing business in corruption hotspots are discussed, and employees feel supported to do the right thing - then an organization can help mitigate against the risk of an ethical lapse.</p>
<p>A modern approach to employee learning is a key component in the fight to tackle corruption. If employees are not equipped to know and report criminal activity then the organization risks potential reputational failure, years of investigations, and the possibility of billions of dollars in fines. This is why organizations need to foster a risk-aware and judgement-based ethics and compliance company culture, where the promotion of core values, setting of expectations, and the provision of incentives is clearly supported, nurtured, and embedded in the company as robust, repeatable processes.</p>
<p>The consequences of corruption are undoubtedly damaging - at its core, the erosion of trust prolonging conflict, enabling violent extremism, crippling development and destabilizing economies - undermining the legitimacy of our political systems and destroying brand resilience. But the process of change we are seeing across the globe provides a promising roadmap for the battle against corruption. Policy and enforcement efforts will continue to shift the landscape of compliance for organizations and business leaders.</p>
<p>Only by continuing to think beyond anti-corruption rhetoric and traditional tactics and being more strategic and rigorous in addressing, identifying, and mitigating against bribes and corrupt payments, will organizations keep markets competitive and operate as trustworthy custodians for societies in which they operate.</p>

How would you handle an active shooter in your workplace?</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Active%20Shooter%20in%20the%20Workplace%20Prepare,%20Train%20and%20Respond%20.png" /></div><p>Fire drills are performed all around the world, every day. The alarm goes off, you leave your desk and gather with co-workers in the parking lot until it's clear to return. They are so commonplace that we're not even alarmed when the signal sounds. But, how prepared is your organization for an incident that is 18 times <em>more likely</em> to happen than a fire? Unfortunately, Active Shooters in the workplace are more common than ever before, but most organizations are not training their employees on strategies and tactics to defend themselves. Let's take a look at the numbers:</p>
<ul><li>In the FBI's first study of active shooters, they found that out of 160 active shooter incidents in the United States between 2000 and 2013, over 80%, 132 total, occurred at work.</li><li>Of the 132 worksite shootings, 73 incidents (45.6%) took place at businesses, 39 (24.4%) at schools, 16 (10%) at government sites, and four at health care facilities (2.5%).</li><li>In a 2018 report from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2018/there-were-500-workplace-homicides-in-the-united-states-in-2016.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, from 2015 to 2016 there were 83 more workplace shootings bringing the total to 394.</li><li>Shootings accounted for 394 workplace homicides in 2016 (79% of the total).</li><li>Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolve quickly. Approximately 70% are over in five minutes or less and 67% are over before police arrive.</li><li>In the majority of cases, active shooters use firearms and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims.</li></ul>
<p>We know these statistics may be difficult to comprehend and you may be asking yourself, “How can I prepare for an active shooter incident?” Preparing for an active shooter incident should fall under the umbrella of life safety programs such as fire/evacuation and tornado/shelter preparedness. It should be treated as a worst case scenario that is practiced so that employees are as familiar with what to do during this incident as walking to the muster location during a fire drill. When creating a training program, organizations should structure the training so that it does not cause alarm or panic.</p>
<h3>Be Prepared</h3>
<p>Three basic steps most commonly used if an active shooter enters the workplace: run, hide and fight. Staying safe and protecting yourself is your primary goal. For each of the steps, there are safety precautions and tips to use to help you stay safe. One note to make is that fighting is the last option anyone should take when dealing with an active shooter.</p>
<p>For those employees in leadership roles, it is critical to send an alert signaling the incident through your organization's communication system such as email and text. The facts should be stated in plain language so everyone comprehends the full details of the situation.</p>
<p>Another tip that employees need to be aware of is law enforcement's role when they arrive on the scene. Law enforcement's first job is to find and neutralize the threat. They will not know who is the suspect(s) and who are the employees, therefore employees should keep their hands visible, open and up at all times.</p>
<h3>Get Educated</h3>
<p>We know that it can seem overwhelming to prepare for an active shooter incident, however it is a fact of life. If you and your employees are not prepared, now is the time. Watch the on-demand webinar recording below. You will learn strategies and helpful information so that you are ready should this incident happen in your workplace. </p>

Crossing the line between gift-giving and bribery, however, leads your organization down the road of reputation ruin. This holiday season, steer clear with a firm policy.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Alan-Gift%20Guide%202018_%20Unwrap%20the%20Best%20Corporate%20Holiday%20Gift%20Ideas-2.png" /></div><p>What's the best corporate holiday gift idea? Arm your employees with knowledge on what is acceptable versus what could land them with coal in their stocking, and your brand on the naughty list.</p>
<p>Gift-giving can easily turn to bribery in the corporate world and hefty gifts come with hefty price tags − namely, brand and reputation. In March 2014, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10679362/Rolls-Royce-investigated-in-US-over-bribery-claims.html" title="Rolls Royce was investigated over bribery claims in the U.S.">Rolls Royce was investigated over bribery claims in the U.S.</a>, around the alleged payment to the son of a former Indonesian dictator to persuade the national airline to buy Rolls' engines. In light of the alleged request, it's easy to see how hefty gifts can have alternate meanings. </p>
<p>In instances like Rolls Royce, those brands under ethical review are often required to fund such investigations. The fees have a direct impact on their financial bottom line − not to mention daily haranguing in the press and media about alleged improprieties, pushing consumer confidence and stock prices downward. </p>
<h3>The Gray Area of Gift Giving</h3>
<p>It may seem abundantly clear what is considered acceptable versus what is considered not acceptable. One may think it is appropriate to accept a smaller token of appreciation, such as a gourmet chocolate bar. On the other end of the spectrum, one may also think that it is not appropriate to accept something more lavish, such as tickets to an event. Seemingly, those two choices are black and white. But what about the gray area? What if a gift is presented with 'strings attached', or contingencies? Are your employees knowledgeable on what is 'black and white'?</p>
<p>There are countless other questionable scenarios that could occur − thus the 'gray' area of corporate gift giving. Fortunately, there are corporate gift giving tips employees can keep in mind during this season, as well as throughout the year.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Ensure staff are aware of your <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/compliance_and_risk/compliance_360/apps/hospitality_manager_grc_software/">gifts and hospitality policy</a></strong> − Ensuring everyone is aware of the policy is a great first step. Surely many have seen such a policy during onboarding, but it's good practice to remind them during this season (and throughout the year, periodically) so they are educated and empowered to make the right decisions.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><strong>Type and value of the gift or hospitality</strong> − Some policies state food, but not alcohol can be accepted, while others are more broad. Furthermore, some have a maximum gift value to be given or received. It's good to know this in advance, to prevent a possible decline of the gift. Never accept a gift worth more than corporate guidelines allow. To prevent any suspicion of impropriety, never accept a gift on the condition future products or services would be purchased.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roles of parties involved</strong> − The intent of a gift or hospitable act from a vendor to a client is well-understood. But for vendors to offer a gift to a regulator, trusted official, or other entity where third-party, impartial judgment may be required is considered poor form, and possibly illegal. Be sure roles of gift givers and recipients are very clear. Sometimes even the potential of unethical behavior is enough to raise more than suspicion. When in doubt, steer clear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Location gift/hospitality is given or received</strong> − Organizations that operate outside their home market need to be particularly aware of cross-cultural differences in what is considered appropriate in gift giving and accepting. Various countries and regions operate with different social mores and cultural norms. Accordingly, what may be acceptable in one region may not be in another. This is further complicated in multinational organizations, where employees of differing national and ethnic backgrounds may not work in their native country or region. It's easy to see how confusion can set in about what is acceptable versus what is not.<br /><br />
Furthermore, while in some markets, gifts and hospitality are a widespread and fundamental part of business transactions, regulations can have extraterritorial reach. For instance, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents">UK Bribery Act</a> made the giving and receiving of gifts and hospitality a significant concern for organizations and their employees around the world.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cumulative value of all gifts given to an individual or team</strong> − While a single bottle of wine or trinket may not trigger a specific threshold, it could be part of a collection of gifts over a given period of time − either to a person or entire team. It's important to have a broader view into what your organization gifted to a person, team, or company to avoid overstepping a larger gift receiving policy. Further, as employees receive gifts, those need to be recorded to keep an accurate total received of volume and value. </p></li></ul>
<p>When in doubt, consult a manager, HR, compliance officer, your company's code of ethics, or <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/risk/ethics_and_compliance/">online database of ethics training and learning content</a>. It may seem awkward to ask, but caution here is better than running afoul of corporate policy. As suggested, track everything sent and and received to ensure compliance. Properly tracked gifts ensure compliance and demonstrate above-board behavior during announced or unannounced regulatory reviews. An email or spreadsheet is bound to get lost. Consider a more <a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/compliance_and_risk/compliance_360/apps/hospitality_manager_grc_software/">robust gifts and hospitality solution.</a></p>
<p>It <em>is</em> the thought that counts. The goal of gifts and hospitality are to communicate to recipients the relationship is appreciated. Recipients and potential recipients need to communicate clearly what they can and cannot accept to avoid ambiguity or mixed messages. Above all else, enjoy the end of the calendar year and festive season.</p>

Let’s change that.</p><div class="image-rich-large" ><img alt="" src="https://www.saiglobal.com/uploadedImages/Pages/News_and_Resources/Industry_News/Assurance_SuperHero_Blog_640x340_SAI360.jpg" /></div><p>'Tis the season for joy and thankfulness and to take a few moments out of our day to thank those who help us continuously through the year. Many of us pause and give thanks to our mail carrier, mechanic, daycare provider, and others. Without their help, our day-to-day lives outside of work would be more challenging. What about inside work? What about those who keep us running and out of hot water: our compliance crusaders? You know who they are: those heroes that have gone above and beyond for the greater good of the organization throughout 2018. </p>
<p>During this time of year, we would like to pause and put a spotlight on these heroes that ensure the business stays running and employees stay out of hot water.  <a href="https://www.complianceofficerday.com/">We celebrate compliance professionals every year on September 26</a>, but that doesn't mean we need to limit it to just that day. In fact, we've been sharing their great work throughout the year. Here's a round-up of some of the best blog posts where we shined the spotlight on our fearless heroes.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Shine the Light And Call Attention</h3>
<p>These heroes may not wear utility belts and masks, but they perform heroic work. Let's take a moment and be thankful for the work compliance professionals do. They'll be glad to hear it.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Six Questions With …</h4>
<p>We profiled six compliance professionals at leading organizations and asked them the same six questions to see what makes them tick. The results are enlightening. One common thing among them is the passion to do good, and do good work - the hallmark of any superhero. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/six_questions_with_an_ethics_and_compliance_officer__antonio_fernandez/">Six Questions with an Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer: Antonio Fernández</a></li><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/six_questions_with_an_ethics_and_compliance_officer__ellen_hunt/">Six Questions with an Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer: Ellen Hunt</a></li><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/six_questions_with_an_ethics_and_compliance_officer__ling-ling_nie/">Six Questions with an Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer: Ling-Ling Nie</a></li><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/six_questions_with_an_ethics_and_compliance_officer__melissa_stapleton_barnes/">Six Questions with an Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer: Melissa Stapleton Barnes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/six_questions_with_an_ethics_and_compliance_officer__seth_rice/">Six Questions with an Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer: Seth Rice</a></li><li><a href="https://www.saiglobal.com/en-us/news_and_resources/industry_news/six_questions_with_an_ethics_and_compliance_officer__virginia_macsuibhne/">Six Questions with an Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer: Virginia MacSuibhne<br /><br /></a></li></ul>
<h4>Heroines</h4>
<p>In honor of International Women's Day, we paused to reflect on the many stand-out female professional heroes in the compliance space.</p>

<h4>Be a Hero by Speaking Up In The Workplace</h4>
<p>We can also celebrate a compliance officer's work and the work of the industry as a whole. Their programs and execution is where we see the fruits of their labor. Taking a stand on issues like sexual harassment and workplace bullying are important components to maintaining a respectable, professional working environment.</p>

<p><br />
Thank you once again to all of the compliance heroes who keep us on track and our noses clean. We know that whenever we need you, you're just a phone call away, but the bat signal is deserving of you all.</p>
